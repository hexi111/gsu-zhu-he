 I just read somebody say that "nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." My first reaction, frankly, is not to agree or disagree with the abovementioned statement but, rather, to clarify this person's postion. Did he meant to say that nowadays people pay too much attention to fashion unlike people in the 17th century France? Or was he comparing young Americans of year 2007 reading Vogue and In Style to young Americans of year 1956 reading Vogue and In Style? 
  If I absolutely have to express my humble opinion, I will say that people accross countries and ages never did and never will pay more or, for that matter, less attention to appearence and fashion. Fashion is an ultimate expression of societal approval. wearing clothes of any kind is always a fashion statement, whic is scial in nature. A person weraing Crocs sends a singnal along these lines: I am an earth-friendly, granola-eating liberal. A person wearing 2.000-dollar business siut is all about business and making money. This girl wearing high heels and pretty dress to grad school (me!) just comes from another country, where people "dressing up" means paying respect to your collegues. 
  Dress codes change when society rules change; people's attention to clothes does not change qualitatively.
