Personal appearance is really important, people make their first impression after they saw the person for the first time. so it has a lot to do with how you give yourself and how you appear to others. But can you put too much emphasis in your personal appearance and fashion?

I think this statement is not correct at all because. as I already said people are going to make an first impression after they saw the person for the first time. so if a person comes along with dirty clothes for example, the fellow human beings are maybe not going to have very good impression of this person and they are maybe going to think that this person isn't very intelligent, so they don't even want to get to know this person closer. so the first impression is, in my opinion, the most important, just to give other people the chance to get to know you better.
