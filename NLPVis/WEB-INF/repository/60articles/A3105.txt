Nowadays people do put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  People are spending a large amount of money on buying makeup products, fashionable clothes, shoes, etc.  People not only spend money on fashionable products, but also on expensive brands like Burrberry, A&F, LV, etc.  Teenagers like my friends in Dallas love to go shopping.  My friends would spend almost all of their job payment on clothings and makeup products.  Teenagers do not have an idea of saving money.  Most people are thinking that if they are wearing the most fashionable clothes, or putting on the newest makeup products, then they would be the best.  Last summer, I went to summer school in Plano West Senior High School.  Since Plano is a pretty rich town, teenagers in high schools tend to show off their richness very often.  Students drive the expensive cars like BMW, Benz, Lexus, etc.  The craziest thing is that, they not only drive the expensive cars, they even change cars almost everyday.  Girls in that school changes expensive purses everyday.  If you were not rich enough to compare with them, they would look down on you.  Nowadays teenagers judge people with their appearance.  If you do not look cool, they would think you are a bad person.  Parents always work very hard in order to please their children.  However, this would only make children to be more dependent on parents, and children could never know how this world works.  Children would only know how to spend and not save money.
