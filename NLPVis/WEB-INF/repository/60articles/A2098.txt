In modern time, more and more individual pay much attention on personal appearance and fashion.  Some people said they put too much emphasis on it, but some people thought they are doing what they want to do, and there is nothing wrong about it.  I think to focus on personal appearance and fashion that is a way to relax and have a good mood for themselves even for others.

In some degrees, focusing on personal appearance is a way to respect others.  For instance, assume you are working with a coworker who is not neat and dressed like a beggar.  Do you still want to work with him/her? Hence, making ourselves ordinary is a way to respect others.

Everyone has a method to put pressures off, some people like having a rest, some people like doing sports, and some people liking shopping.  To pay attention on fashion can relax themselves and bring them a good mood.  Why not do not do what they like to do?  It is a way to have a good mood by emphasizing on personal appearance.  Not only did you become very happy,  others felt comfortable from your appearance.

To give ourselves a good mood in our life and to give our friends a good impression,  we focus on our appearances that is nothing wrong.  If you dressed comfortable, you can communicate with your workers or all people more easily and happier.  Paying attention on personal appearance and fashion will help you when you communicate with others.
