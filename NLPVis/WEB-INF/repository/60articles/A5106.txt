I personally agree with this statement; nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

Nowadays, many things have developed and ways for  human to life are getting more modern. People also have hunger for new color for their life which can be expressed by fashion and personal appearance. It might be one's personal interest and likeness towards art (which can be expressed by fashion). But, sometimes people also need to be acknowledged. One of the way is to wear good clothes, and be different in terms of appearance. Another argument is that people need to have confidence in themselves, which can be obtained by wearing fashion and putting make-up which sometimes are too much.
