Nowadays our society is changing a lot.  People's opinions are quite different than before.  The old generation used to live a moderate life, however, the young generation focuses on personal appearance and fashion.  Even worse, some of them stick into this situation.

First, more and more people agree that a elegant appearance will attract much attention.  For example, a well dressed person will get more attraction than a person who just wears casual clothes when they have an on-site interview together.  Therefore, most people inculding the gradulated students will purchase fancy suit/dress without any hesitation because they all want to get good impression by the interviewor.  Of course, not all of them are in the same academic level, however, the interviewor cannot tell difference between them just by their appearance.  

Second, many young generation people are sticking in fashion and personal appearance.  We can easily find advertisements of cosmitics and plastical surgery in newspaper and TV program.  Even though there are many reports that a considerable number of people hurt or even died of plastic surgery, many people will still insist on doing that.  why are they so doged and not consider of danger?  I think the answer is simple: they just want to be more beautiful and attractive.  It's not just for dating or marriage.  In our society, some employer will choose good-looking person.  Although it is unfair, unfortunately, it still happens sometimes.

In summary, I agree that good personal appearance will make ourselves and other people more comfortable.  However, in spite of wasting extra money, some people forcus too much on it even without considering their health.  It should not be encouraged.
