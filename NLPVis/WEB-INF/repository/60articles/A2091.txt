This is a world about fashion. While standing at the center of the crowded business street, you can always see a lot of people wearing beautiful clotheses passing by. Some people criticizes that nowadays people paid too much attention on personal appearence and fashion, however, there is nothing  wrong about fashion or the focus on personal appearence.

People all love beautiful things. Persuing the beauty is like the nature in their bones. Everyone must have been surprised  by the  broad sea when they forst saw it. Everyone must have been attracted by a beautiful girl or cute boy. People enjoy the beauty of the nature everyday, beauty is never too much.  Because of this nature , people like to be with others that have a good-looking appearence. According to mate-selection survey, the main factor that affect American prople to chose a mate is his or her physical appearence. So there is never too much emphasis on the persuing of the beautiful appearence.

A good personal appearence can give others a good first impression. Before you talk to a person, the personal appearence is the only thing that you can judge this person. So, it is acceptable that people will put so much emphasis on their own appearence. 

Of course that, a good heart is more important than beauty. However, It is better that they can have a good heart as well as a lovely appearence.  Emphasis on personal appearence and the fashion is just the nature in people that they like beautiful things and to make a good first-impression. In my personal perspective, it is understandable that people focus on their appearence and the fashion.
