Today, lots of people pay more attention on personal appearance and fashion. Obversely, it is becoming one of the symbols in twenty-first century which showing what is beauty. Although some people think there may be to much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, I don't think like that.Our society needs fashion. Our life also needs it. There are some reasons to support my viewpoint.
 
First, personal appearance and fashion will benefit our society a lot because it is a big product which can make us earn money. We can't deny that lots of companies begin to participate the field of helping people make up. Why they do this? Because they smell the big profit in the field. That is the  real motion to encourage them. We can say that in other way that it makes our society to get benefit.  

Second, we can not imagine that we still wear the dirty  clothes walking on the road. In that case, we need fashion, because it can make us becoming beautiful. Everyone like  to be a beautiful person in our life, and we like other people  praise out personal appearance. In other words, our life need  personal appearance and fashion.

All in all, there is no doubt that people pay more attention on  personal appearance and fashion than the old time, but it is not too much.
