People do seem to put too much emphasis on appearance and fashion, because they are the constant topic of the media.  What people wear and how they look seem to get more attention during famous award ceremonies, other important events, and in everyday lives than any other things in recent years.  With the culture supporting such rigid ideas, people who don't follow along becomes the outcasts or what they call a "fashion victom".   
I believe such idea was created by insecurities, and the generation who crave any form of instant gratification. 
Lacking the internal satisfaction and happiness, people turn to external/material things to overcompensate the emptiness they experience.  As more and more people look for happiness from outside rather than within, consequently cause the conspicuous consumption that makes people believe that they need to look certain ways to prove or show their status; creating even bigger problem of high debt and financial difficulties.
