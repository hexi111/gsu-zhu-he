Every people like nice things and there is nothing wrong with that. It is just a common sense. However, beautiful appearance is not everything. 

You can like the beauty of a girl, but you also like your friends and your friends are not necessary beautiful. You like them not because of they are attractive but because they share happiness and sadness with you and they are by your side when you need them.

Men all like to look at beautiful girls. But not all of men have beautiful wife. People need a partner that can understand and living with, not a person just for watching. But nowadays, people put too much effort on clothes and appearance just trying to have attention. Actually it has some good effect because it makes life more colorful and beautiful. But the outside beauty should comes with the inside beauty. The inside beauty is friendliness, loveliness, helpfulness, well-educated and etc. A girl can attract a man by her nice appearance but that man would leave if someday he find out the girl is fool.

People can not always young and beautiful. The outside beauty one day will be destroy but the inside beauty is last forever. So, it is meanless if people only put their effort on appearance and fashion and ignore how to build up the inside beauty.
