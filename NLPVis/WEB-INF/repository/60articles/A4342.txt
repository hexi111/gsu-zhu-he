The statement, "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion" is very much true. We as human race have become more and more materialistic with the passage of time. we have a never ending appetite for more and more fame and success. And we have realized that looking more glamourous is one of the easy way to achieve it sooner.

We as a race have grown to realize that brands sell. Packaging and appearance of this brands is one of the main reasons for their popularity. All this has nurtured the thought that being attractive will help us be more successful. And there have been studies and researches published which point to this fact. Hence the emphasis on personal apearance and fashion.

And looking good is in a way important as it gives a person that extra self-confidence. As we realize that people will be accepting us better. Because most of the time first impression about a person is made by just looking at them.

Looking good has become imporatant these days. For example when apple comes out with a new product, its not only the new features that drives hordes to buy it. But also how it has been designed and how it looks. Even the car makers are also focusing on makign cars more attractive to prospective customers, apart from making them more comfortable and faster.

Growing peer pressure is another factor that is making people more fashion savvy. Today we just cannot live without not having latest fashion accessories and cool gadgets  which our friends posses. Corporate world is also branding its new products to gain maximum leverage out of the basic human psyche to outdo each other in tems of remaining more fashionable and good looking.

All in all this media blitzkreg to sell more and more, alongwith inherent human nature to be better than the rest, is forcing us to lay a greater emphasis on external beauty.
