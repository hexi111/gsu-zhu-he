I totally agree the above statement that recent years people pay much attention on personal appearance and fashion.

First, from my experience, the youngsters eager to buy the high quality clothes or famous band makeup.  In my alimentary school, the classmates only focused on the study and how to got the high grade in the final exam.  They never thought about whether the classmates wore the beautiful clothes.  But when I entered the university, I have found the young people put the emphasis on one who wore the famous band cloth.  Besides the clothes, the other things, such as MP3, sunglasses, purse, pen, also own the great band.  Most  of the clothes will cost 500 or even more.  These are my experience and I have sensed the people want to have more fashion style.

Second, not only do the companies want to use the employee who has the beautiful face, but also the audience request the singers or movie stars have good  appearance.  In our country, none of the company wants to hire a worker whom has an ugly face.  The company think this will destroy the company's fame and the company won't obtain the new customs and won't earn enough money.   Did you see an ugly man becomes a famous star in the kingdom of entertainment?  That's why most of the stars do the surgery on the faces or the bodies.  They want to perfect theirs' shape of bodies and the appearance to earn more claps and money.

Third, most people judge the people from the appearance.  Usually the pretty girls or a cool boys is the most popular people in our society. 

In my opinion, people severely focus on the appearance and fashion of a person recently.
