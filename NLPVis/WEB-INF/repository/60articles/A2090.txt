Some people think personal appearance and fashion is very important, but on the other hand some people think it's not important. They say important thing is personality not a appearance. I can't say which one is more important. Since it is very different depends on person, job or gender.

First of all, the priority of the fashion is very different as a job. Last month I read a book which newspaper report for politician section wrote the book. She said when she was studying in University in Boston, she was wearing any pants or T-shirts, since she was student, and the one of the most important work is studying in student. However since she had worked as newspaper writer in Washington, she was wearing formal suit. Because she had to meet many politicans to have interviews, and the appearance give the first impresstion to the interviewers. Like in this case how much fashion is important is different as a job.

Second, the emphasis on personal appearance is also different as gender. Nowadays the acceptance about fation in people was changed much. For a long time ago, the thinking about fashion was very different between man and woman. Normally women have wanted to have pretty and beautiful clothes, but men had not spend much money for clothes. In the long time ago, the gender was separately somewhat strictly. However someone say the present is unisex world. Nowadays many men have accepted the fashion as important, but still many of part of men think fashion is not important.

Nowadays many people say personal appearance is very important, but it's different as a job and gender. If someone is student, the appearance is not important. Moreover, even to professor the appearance is not important, the most important is their study.
