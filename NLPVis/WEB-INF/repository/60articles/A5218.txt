There is a statement states that Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

In my opinion, nowadays, people do pay more attention on personal appearance and fashion. But it is unfair to say "too much". My stand of point can be supported by following reasons. 

First of all, it is never too much for people to emphasis their appearance and fashion. Our apperance can make the first empression of ourselves. Many people may determine what kind of people you are according to your appearance. A good looking may sometimes help us to get a job, or to develop business. It is necessary for us to make our apperance attractive. Puting emphasis on personal apperance and fashion is the require of the society. 

Sceond, different people have different opinion on personal appearance thus they will put different emphasis on appearance and fashion to match their social status, their occupation and their income. Stars may spend $10,000 per month on fashion and appearance while graduate student like me will only spend $100 on that. No matter how much we spand, it just match our income, and that is nothing can be critiqued. 

We have to admit that it is not need to over-emphasize personal appearance and fashion, as the social development depends on our work, our widom, not our appearance. But pay some attention will may ourselves more attractive and make our world more beautiful. So why not?
