See this title, everyone must have their own opinion. someone think the appearance is important and the other do not think that. and in my opinion, I do not think appearance is very important.

First, the appearance can not be decided by yourself, which means your are born with it. So everyone can not change their appearance. So for me, I do not worry about all the things what I can not choose.

Second, comparing the appearance, I think the other things such as the ability, the attitude especial the  confidence are more important than the appearance. No doubt, good appearance can give a good impression for a new person. However, liking a  famous people says "the appearance attract another person only the first meet, but whether he will communicate with you is decided by the attitude." And also,in the social, the impression of judging a person is not by the appearance, but by the ability, the attitude and the confidence.

Third, most of the people are normal people. For instance, not everyone can become the models, the actors even the movie stars. So for these reasons, I do not think the people should pay more attention to the appearance. And they should pay more attention to the normal things such as the lives, the jobs and others. 

Finally, for one word, my opinion is the appearance is not very important, and I hope everyone has a good attitude to face their appearance. "do not worry about your appearance, it is given by the God".
