There is a saying, first inmpression is the most lasting. And we all understand that first impression comes from appearance and outfit person has on. However, some people believe that we put too much emphasis on it. I personally think, that it is nessasary to pay attention what the appereance of the person is like. There are several reasons for that.

Appereance is ussualy a map you can use to determine person's character or background. It can help tremendously to avoid misunderstanding or awkward situations. For example, when you see somebody wearing a t-shirt with a Texas map on it, you can conclude that he or she is from Texas or at leat has been to Texas. So now you have common topic to talk about and you can make new aquantance.  

A lot of emphasis should be placed on appereance when you hire someone for customer related job. People always look at you first before they diside wether they will trust this compony or not. In this case, person is an ambasodor of the company and everything will depend on his appereance wether customer wants to continue business with them.

On the other side, sometimes people are too picky about clothes and fasion. It couses many problems between parents and their kids. Teenagers are ussually the ones who are concearned with fassion most. Women are sometimes go crazy about the way they look. The are ready to undergo serious surgery in order to get brest size they want to have.

In conclusion I would like to say that I agree with those people who think that appereance is very important in our life. Clothes helps to express one's person inner world and by looking at persons appereace we can come up with many conclussions about his cultural background or affliation. Sometimes it is too much emphasis placed on appereance. There should be balance in everything.
