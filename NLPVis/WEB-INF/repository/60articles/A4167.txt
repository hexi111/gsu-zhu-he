From the old ages, people have considered personal appearance as very important. In the early days, men and women used to decorate themselves with jewellery and flowers. The concept of personal appearanace is even applicable to animals. Peacocks have beautiful feathers to attract peahens. Similarly lions have a huge mane of hair on their heads to attract females.

I definitely agree that its a good thing to emphasise on personal appearance and fashion. When we appear well dressed, its a sign of self confidence and self esteem. People who dress sloppily or who are unkempt in their appearance do not hold themselves in high esteem as they are not taking care of themselves. For e.g. in a job interview, a person who is not dressed properly is less likely to be received favorably as he might be considered uninterested or incompetent. Also appearance of a person makes the first impression and as the old adage goes " First impression is the Last Impression".

Its not important that the clothes be expensive or you must have spent hundreds of dollars in grooming. But you should be neat and clean in appearance and should appear comfortable in whatever you wear. There is no use of wearing high heels when you are not at ease with them. Infact , wearing something uncomfortable might make an unfavourable impression on people.

Appearanace is considered to be a matter of personal taste but you should dress up keeping in mind where you are going. Inappropriate appearance is also not good. Also, like they say, too much of anything is also not good. so too much emphasis on appaearnace might even distract you from the real purposes.

Lastly, there is a rule of thumb in the business world. A person should dress not for the job he has but for the job he wants. Thus appearance is important and people should take care with it.
