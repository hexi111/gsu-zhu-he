As a girl from the middle class, I've personally enjoyed fasion through my life. And it's true that there's been always issue about being fasionable or not.

When I was at high shool, being fasionable was very important thing to be popular. Almost all popular girls kept them fasionable. Even at the elementary school, children bullied some students who always wore the same clothes everyday. And bullied children often became angry with their parents who didn't allow them to buy. 

Now in my home country, Japan, not only girls but also guys are crazy about being fasionable buying Coach bags and Gucci shoes. It even happens to high shool students buying brands. Some of them are not aware of leather, cotton and wool. Even though they don't know about the real value of the products, they work to buy them skipping classes and show off to their friedns. What is that for?

Fasion is important in the business field. I was surprised that one of my firends working as a vice president at a company had a $300,000 watch on his wrist. It sounds crazy for me as a student, but it's "status" for a business man. And it's true there is stereotyping thought that fasionable and clean person is more trustful. And it's easier to have people respond for surveys at downtown when you are in the suits.

 In my opinion, it's a good thing that people can emphasis on their fasion. It's the evidece that they are rich enough in time and money. What is not preferrable is that they concentrate only on their fasion and become blind about others and worlds. You always have to remember that there's fasion business trying to make you buy many clothes, and moreover it's just an outfit which is meanless in somewhere in the world.
