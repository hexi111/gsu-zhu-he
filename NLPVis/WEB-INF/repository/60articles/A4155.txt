Body image is a serious problem in our society nowadays. With the rise of celebrity power and influence in all various areas of our daily life, we put way too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

If you just take a quick glance at the newstand, you can easily identify beautiful women with flawless features and hourglass figures. Or at least that is what the team of makeup artists, hair designers, and airbrush experts make them out to be. Unfortunately, in our society, the media propaganda has people believing in its own idealogy of beauty. People, especially women suffer from this set standard of beauty. Thinking that they are too fat, too skinny, too pale, etc., people are willing to spend a generous amount of money in diet pills, cosmetic surgery, and clothes to compensate for their perceived imperfections. In addition, our society is taught to be judgemental on a person's physical appearance. A female excutive reports in a magazine that she has to spend at least $15,000 year on clothes to impress her clients. Though it is not an outspoken  appearance to some degree helps determine a person's sucess in all aspects of their lives.
