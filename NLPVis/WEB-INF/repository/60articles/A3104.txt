Since very ancient times, people have been looking for a way to be attractive and be fashion. This can easily be explained from the biologiacal point of view, where a animals try to find the partner or partners to continue their kind. 

I agree with the statement above but not with the negative aspect of it that people too much emphasize theira appiarence. There are several reasons. One of them is that nowadays, in the era of hi technology and information, people have even more time for following fashion movements and paying attention to their personal appearences. And the second is the fashion an the personal appearence is a refletion of great intelligence of humans like all arts and sciences.

First, people, almost all over the world, now got 40-hour working week. Various-purpose-robots and computer machines appeared, which would greatly automate very tedious and routing work for people. Entertainment business is blossoming. People started to be extremely interactive with each other. It was counted that each pearson on average has about 5000 interactions with other persons per day in big cities. For that reason, people want to look nicer and attract people or potential partners. They want to express their success, may be their ideas.

Second, pearsonal appearences and fashion is a 100% art. There is no such thing as too much emphasis on some things in art, except of course when it touches somebody's belief or sexuality. (It is the other problem)  It is a strait sign of intelligence. We design, create, show our views on the life. 

To sum up, paying attention to your look and follow the fahsion is never too much
