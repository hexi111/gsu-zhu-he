now, when you go and walk on the streets, you can find lots of advertisement posts. the most of them are drawn the beautiful girls and handsome men who can grasp people`s attention. So someone said,"Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." I think it is true.

We can not deny appearance is important to people. When a person hunt for a job, a good appearance can bring he or she more opportunities. thus, people want to improve their appearance in anyway no matter to spend a lot of money or to bear the physical pain in the operations.  But a wise leader never wants his members only have old appearance. the best way to proof yourself is to use your knowledge and solve problems. Appearance can bring in some profits but it can not last for a long time. Meanwhile, a successful company can not use the appearance to make it strong. 

so although I agree this statement,  I do not encourage people to do so. because everyone can not always young and he or she has the old day in the future. 

appearance can be a good communicate tool but do not abuse it.
