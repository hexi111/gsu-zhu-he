As the saying goes "The first impression is the best impression ".This idiom could never be more appropriate than in todays competitive world.

In todays world where, time is money and an opportunity missed may never turn up again, it is important to grab an opportunity with both hands and excel at it.

This doesnt mean that you should depend only on your skills and wait for an opportunity to show up.You should be able to market yourself and create an opportunity for yourself.

Marketing yourself  and creating opportunities depends upon the impression you create and the way you  dress is one of the tools to  impress others.

This trend of dressing to impress is so ingrained in todays society that a huge market has opened up just to cater to that.This my friends is the Fashion and luxury good market.

This reflects on today society and its priorities. So in todays society appearance is every thing as people do not have the time to understand you.
