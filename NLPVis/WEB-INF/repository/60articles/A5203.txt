Personal appearnce or fashion these days are more of a symbol that represents your style and your personality. It is not just something which corvers your inside. For these reasons i agree with the statement that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

Personal appearance is how we were born and genetically given by our parents. As we grow up we begin to look like our parents or anyone from the family. It is not like clothes where we can change and wear or take off anytime we want. It was impossible to change our looks until recently the boom of plastic surgery hit the town. Now people are spending lots of money on fixing their faces. It is not a moral thing to do. The way you look is a gift from your parents and from god. People nowadays don't care as they want to look more young pretty and handsome.

Fashion in another way is something which human creted to cover their body up. It has bagan way back in the times of Adam and eve. This has been used as a tool to protect from the UV rays of the sun and the cold weather during the winter. But now fashion with expensive brands like Gucci, Prada and Armani people are spending lots of money to wear these brands. Many would say it is because they look good and make you look good. But, it is being used as a item to represent your wealth. 

Above i have explained my reasons on why i do agree with the statement that too much enphasis are put to  personal appearance and fashion.
