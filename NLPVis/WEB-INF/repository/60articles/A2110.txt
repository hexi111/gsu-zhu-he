I do not agree that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. It is necessay and useful even helpful fot people to live in society right now.

Good appearance is a kind of wealth and sometime, it can help us to beat our oppoents. In China, every year, there is a strong compition between the job hunters. There are thausands of graduation students. when their
ability of study, working, and other things is kind of equal, the final judgement of the boss is probably the impression which is coming from the appearance of the job hunters. At that time, for them, the appearance is so important no matter they put how much emphasis on it. Probably you regarded it as a unfair thing, but for the boss, why do they have to choose the one who do not care their appearance and give up the one who pay attention to thier appearance when they are both suitbale for the job.

The strange will decide you by your appearance and fashion. Everyone wants to leave other a good impression, which not only depends on your words or behaviors but also your appearance and fashion. The good appearance and fashion will help to keep you in other minds. the feeling of being the concentrate of people makes us more and more popular.

A good appearance will keep people in good mood, because it helps us to set up our confidence, which will benefit in our study or work.

Couclusion, I don't think people put too much emphasis on the personal appearance and fashion, because it is the need of their life or work, even the key to success.
