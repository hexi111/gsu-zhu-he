I don't entirely agree with the statement. Personal appearance and fashion are important in our life, however, they are not the most important, I think true beauty comes from within. 

Sometimes, they seem to be of tremendous importance, such as on a stage, during an interview. I believe they will consider ohter factors at the same time, such as their performance on a stage, how they behave during an interview, which are on top of appearance and fashion.

It is not uncommon to hear of great people who don't care much about their arrparnaces, scuh as Albert Einstin, the greatest physicist ever. As far as I know, few people looked down on him just because of his appearance. After all, great achievements are far more valuable than those blank minds with fashionable appearances.

Maybe models of fashion shows put their appearances on top of everything, don't forget, they are well trained before walking on a stage, appearances and fashions are but the last step. Could anybody who wears fashionable clothes/garments be a successful model on a stage? Needless to say, appropriate training and their own endeavors contribute to their sueccesses to a large extent. 

Admittedly, in a civilized society, moderate appearances and fashions are indispensable, few people wants to appear terrible. Even though we still have great people who dress casually, I believe they don't do it on purpose, partly because they don't want to waste time on it.
