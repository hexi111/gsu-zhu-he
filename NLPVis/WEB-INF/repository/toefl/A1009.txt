This essay talks about the problem that people put too much empahsis on personal appearance and fashion nowsadays. I agree with the statement that people care about their appearance and fashion much more than before. The reasons go as followers. 

First of all, I take the teenagers for example. Nowadays teenagers spend more time on their appearance than before. They will put most of their time to buy fashion clothes and making up. They put less time on their assignments and studies comparing to before. They should more time on their studies rather than dressing up.

Second, the adults also have the same problem. Taking the movie stars and singers for example. Because of the Internet and television, the movies stars and singers have much more impect to publics than before. This change affects the value of nowadays people. Right now, people spend abanden of time on imminating the movie stars and singers. The adults also care a lots about the brand of the clothes and the presitige which presesnts. The appearance can not represent all the personalities of a person. The people nowsadays should put emphasis on other aspects than appearances.     

To sum up, nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion not only on teenagers but also on adult. As a result, I agree with the point of this essay.
