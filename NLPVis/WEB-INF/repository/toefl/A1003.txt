There are two main mistakes in "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." First, "some people (mostly single people)" put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Most of the people want to feel confortable and confident with the way they look, but they know that it is not the most important aspect of themselves. Also, most of the people look for a partner taking into consideration the look just in the initial stage of a relationship. later on, what comes to be important are the personal values and characters.  As well, the silly criticism to the present  time in contrast to past times, is the best way to show that whoever says that is not thinking much. The most primitive civilizations realized about personal appearance and the importance of looks for personal and tribal identification. Also, yes, they had fashion as well. primitive men and women used body decorations to express themselves. They used make up, animals' skins, and jewelry. They also had clear standards of beauty and social acceptance. Today, nothing has changed. Actually, with so much more people in this world, we do need to rely more on expressing our own personality and values since it simplifies the process of meeting people with values similar to ours and finding our partners for life.
