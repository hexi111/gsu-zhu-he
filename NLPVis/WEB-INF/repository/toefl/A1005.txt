There is an old saying-- everyone has a heart prefering to the beautiful.  Today, we still like being good-looking. Some say that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. In my opinion, it depends on  the importance of appearance in different occasions and the level of emphasis paid.

There is no doubt that we would rather pretty things to those ugly or just normal. When looking into a group of people, we can easily figure out the conspecuous ones with outstanding looking. According to this human instinct, you can't pay too much emphasis on personal appearance when having an interview or in a formal party. 

On the other hand, entertainment industry is growing day by day. Ladies, especially young girls have their communications occupied almost all by the clothes and accessories worn by the stars or produced by the famous company. Spending days just for looking for the popular earring is not an occasional thing in the 15 to 20 years' old generation. Chasing after too close such "entertaining things" too much forms pessimistic opinions towards values. 

In conclusion, paying more attension on your face and attire every morning before leaving home is always a good thing. While too many good things will turn to the opposite side. Being addicted in cosmetics or owning the "in-fashions" is now a social problem in the young group still unsolved.
