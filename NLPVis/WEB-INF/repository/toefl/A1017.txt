The importance of personal apperance and fashion has been one of peoples primarly concerns since a few centuries ago.  When kings started becoming fashion icons back in the fifteenth century, people  started becoming more aware of their looks. Fashion and personal apperance were an etiquette rule.
Today more people,  pay close attention to their image, but for different reasons.  Now they do not do it because it is consider to be chic; they do it because the media has done a great job trying to convince people to do so in order to survive.  The fashion industry has grown a great deal because everyone wants to wear what ever is in style, and because fashion changes more often than what it used to.

Since we were little, we were taught that the first impression you make is always the most important one.  Obviously, you personal apperance is the first thing that is going to give you away.  There is a lot of competion nowadays, and we all want to stand out.  In order to do so, you have to pay attention not only to what is inside your head, but to what is in the outside too.

Vanity used to be only a women's thing, but now many men are starting to pay more attention to their looks, and becoming more aware of fashion trends.  They are spending more money on clothes, grooming and physical fitness.

Also, words like bulimia and anorexia have become part of our daily vocabulary.  More and more teenage kids, it is not only girls anymore, are dealing with these types of eating disorders. 

We keep seeing very thin and well dressed celebrities , so everyone wants to imitate them.  They are people who go out and spends thousands of dollar in clothes just to look like a glamourus celebrity.

Regardless of all that, we should always keep in mind that personal hygene and our health should be our top pryorties.  It is fine to put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, but it is also important to put as much emphasis on our health.
