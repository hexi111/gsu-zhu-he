I would agree on the statement that people are putting a lot of emphasis on the personal appearance these days and also feel that they have a good enough reason to believe so.

In this modern world, the first impression of a person comes from his external apperance and this is predominantly perceived from the clothes a person wears. This may be the primary reason why one would prioritize personal apperance over other attributes.

Let me elucidate on my stand by providing you with some examples. Given a situation when we attend a job interview in a reputed company. We would pay equal attention in arranging the folders which contains all our professional and educational qualifications and chosing the right dress to wear for the occasion. It woud be right to do so, as the interviewer usually makes the decision to hire you or not within the first 30 seconds of the interview, and it would be necessary for one to impress the interviewer within this short period of time. This can be done by wearing smart clothes which generates a postive impression about you and also speaking in a crisp manner. 

The personal apperance of a person can also be associated with the importance which a person given to an occasion. A person takes his time to look presentable only when he wants to impress a person and doesn't feel the necessity to otherwise impress the person who he is meeting. 

The reason why people perceive personal appearance as important can be related to the examples cited above. It is very important that one should not completley base thier impression about a person  based on the personal apperance due to the fact that apperance can be deceptive. One can easily appear physically smart but actually be no where near it actually.
