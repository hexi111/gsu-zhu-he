Apprearance has always been an important issue in human history. Still we read about the beauty goddesses of ancient times. Moreover, there are many ancient sculptures and  many  more current portraits depicting the beauty of their times. Hence, I don not think that  people put too much empahasis on personal apperance and fashion since these two have always been important. Obviously, people spend more on apperance and fashion these days. Nevertheless, it is not because people give more importance to it than they did in the past, but it is because they can afford it now.

Human beings have desires on the one hand and constraints (or budgets) on the other. Since economic well being of people have increased greatly in the last few centuries, now, people have bigger budgets to satisfy their desires. Obviously, this statement is not true for the whole world. Nevertheless, I assume that this statement is based on the perceptions about western society. 

Around the time of WWII, people would struggle to satisfy their basic nutricion and shelter needs. Nowadays, they can afford a descent amount of food and a descent quality of shelter. Hence, they can look to satisfy their other needs, for example, finding a attractive mate for themselfs, gaining accpetance in society, or just getting the attention of others. Obviously, beauty and appearance are strong tools in terms of achieving such things. 

Therefore, I disagree with the idea that personal appearance and fashion became too important for the people. It just emerged more strongly since other needs of the people are already satisfied.
