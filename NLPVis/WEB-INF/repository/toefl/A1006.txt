I strongly agree with the importance of appearence.  I do not even care Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  For example, in job areas, employers prefer to have good looking and clean-cut appearance for their company.  It shows appearance is as important as ability that companies really pursue.  Moreover, if people have good appearance, they apparently have great self-satisfaction at any places.  Also, if I suppose to say between men and women, each different sex attracted by good looking appearence.  This is come from what people want to see and have more interests in today's people.  To conclude, nowaday's people put som much emphasis on their personal appearance and fashion because if this society's atmosphere.  Of course people have the feeling that wants to appeal to others.  For this reason, I think that emphasizing good looking appearence is not anymore critical opinion.
