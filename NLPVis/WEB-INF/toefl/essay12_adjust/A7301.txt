Disagree:

Why does people emphasis a lot on appearance and fashion? The way they dress and appear is too much for some people at some places like school, shopping ,and church.

Dressing well is good to some extent. some students they put too much effort in to their dressing that they dress extra ordinarly when coming to school. For example,some of them wear party clothes like short skerts, and different kinds of clothes that are made for a special occasion like wedding,church,and some other. If we all think this is also taking our time and our money ,if we are thinking of  a good apearance and dressing we have to get well prepared before we get out of our house that means we are spending lot of time on it. Some time in scool people are too much concerned that they even go to bathroom and look haw they look and make some changes I think this kinds of things are too much. 

In conclusion, it is ok to dress normal and leave in  our own way of  life style instead of westing time and money  to impress other people.
