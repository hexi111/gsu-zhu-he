I disagree.

First the word "people" covers everybody in this world, or at least 75%, and I think it is overestimated. For example, the people from North Korea do not care about their appearance and obviously to have enough food is the first thing to consider.  The diversity of the people, i.e. different aera, different culture, differnet age, gender, tells us that some people might put too much emphasis on their appearance and fashion, but some other people even don't care about the clothes they wear.

Secondly, not everybody who cares about the appearance put "too" much emphasis on it.  People wear the expensive suit when join the big event like a wedding ceremany, and they wear the casuals at weekends.  Some people care about their looks because they want to show their respects and also need the respect from their coworkers. It is a good thing to wear the right clothes for different situations. 

In a word, it is a good and appropriate thing to wear the right clothes, to have a healthy and strong body, to have the right makeup if these things will give you the confidence about yourself and will not hurt the otheir people's eyes.
