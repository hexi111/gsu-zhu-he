Clothing was orignally designed for protect our bodies from cold weather. Hence, it was simple like putting some pieces of cloth together to make clothes. However, fashion had been raised to be an issue that affected the public, especially in teenagers. Nowadays, people tended to follow the trends designed by some designers, most in United State and Japan. They almost controlled the fashion trends all over the world.  Teenagers spent all their pocket money to catch up the trend. 

First of all, the teenagers may try to work part-time during their school year to gain some more money that can fulfill their desire to the fashion trend. Some of them even skip the classes, and eventually their academic results are being negative affected. They put their money into the trend in order to create their images among their peer. They would like to get into the "gang", and draw attentions. Hence, they are willing to pay for it.

On the other hand, criminals had been raised to be a critical issue among the society. Some of the families cannot affort to pay their kids for fashion. Hence, some of the youth may try to make bad friends who may have the same situation with them to rob the stores. Most of them know that robbing stores commited crimes, but they are willing to take the risks in order to build their images and confidence among the peer.

Nowadays people, especially youth, put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. They are deeply affected by the fashion trend. However, they misunderstand the original meaning of clothing. They just try to put all their effort to catch up with the trend with the real reason behind, building their images and confidence among their peer. They really focus on the wrong way.
