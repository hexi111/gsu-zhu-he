  I strongly agree that planning carefully when we are young will give us better lives in the future.

     Time is alwayls not enough for most of people. Hence, we have to plan ahead no matter what events we are going to engage in. When we want to travel during our vacation, we make plans for the trip. When we want to apply for admission to a school, we provide our study plans. If we have plans, we can know what to prepare now and what we will encounter in the near future. Then, we can handle emergency situations and have good outcomes.

     When we do not have plans for the upcoming events, we usually feel nervous. Once we are nervous, our performance definitely will be affected. Then, we have worse results than as usual. In our daily life, we have many chances to make decisions.  If we do not have plans before making the decision, we cannot expect a good result for it. In contrast, when we plan for the future, we have the awareness of what will happen and what we should do in each case. Of course, more carefully we plan, better outcomes we get.

     Planning ahead of time prepare us with sufficient ability to take control over the situations. When we have plans, we are more confident that we can do things well. Therefore, I believe that having plans ensure me a good future.
