I strongly agree that young people should plan carefully to ensure a good future in his or her life. Good plan can help your better organize your time.

In the highly competitive world today, students are busy with all course works, social lives and sporting activities etc. While the adults are busy with heavy work, family life and social lives etc. How to organize the time in your calender to make sure keep balance between "have to do" and "love to do" is really important to ensure a success in your career. 

Every person has 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Why different persons achive different accomplishments? The anwer to this is a good plan. Good plans can make you spend your time effectively and efficiently. For example, Bill Gates started to set up his own business when he was still a college student. He even don't pick up a dollar on the floor because he thinks that he can make more than this amount at the  time for picking  the money up. Also, when he is working on his Microsoft company, he is still willing to pay attention to the charity activities and denote a lot of money to help poor people. 

Not everyboday should be a scientist, an artist or an entrepreneur, but good plan really can help to organize your life better.
