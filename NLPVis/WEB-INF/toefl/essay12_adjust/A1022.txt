I think People in modern society too much focus on their appearance and fashion. Some people argue that personal appearance and fashion is only their own taste and there is few people only fucus on their appearance. However, the effect of mass media lead people to emphsis on their apperance more and more. Therefore, I agree that statement. 

First of all, mass media affect on people's thought, and the mass media is too much focus on star's appearance and fashion. The movie stars are used to get the plastic surgery in order to make themselves more beautiful. In addition, the stars are having the diet for losing their weight.  More and more people is watching a television, and people tend to imitate the star's apperance and fashion. As a result, people want to get the plastic surgery as the stars did or fast their food in order to maintain their body slim as the stars did. For example, in my country, the young girls put too much emphasis on their appearance. As a result, they want to apply make-up and get the plastic surgery, even though they are too young. In addition, they cannot concentrate on their study because they only focus on their appearance. Therefore, I think that is because peope too much focus on their appearance and fashion in thesedays.

Second of all, people sometimes discriminate and judge people as their appearance. People can easily find if they are not enough get dress-up, they are not accepted in luxouious reastaurant or dress-shop. That is because most people think that personal appearance and fashion is important that their personal character.  

In conclusion, nowadays people is focusing on their appearance too much. That leads people to judge other people only by their appearance. That is not desirable because the appearance is not all things to judge the person. Instead, personality should be considered by judging people.
