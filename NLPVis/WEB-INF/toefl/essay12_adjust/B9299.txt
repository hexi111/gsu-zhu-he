While I was little, my parents always told me to do my best in school. They believed if I get my degree in a better university, that will provide me a better future. In order to get into a good university, I need to have good academic results from my high school. So, everything is about planning ahead. My parents have the life experience that I don't have, and they believe the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to plan carefully while I'm still young. I totally agree with that. 

Taking myself as an example, I am a classical singer. I started my piano training at the age of 9. I started my individual voice lessons at the age of 14. I did not plan to become a musician at that time, that was just my interest. However, when I got into college, I realized I started my piano lessons too late. All the pianists in my class started their lessons before the age of 6. That created a difference. It does not mean I can never become a professional pianist if I started piano lessons after the age of 6, but it is just harder. The musical training in the early childhood promotes the musical sensitivity of a child, it also enhances its aural skills. It will take a longer time to develope it after one is grown up. And the development of the finger muscles also takes flight at the early childhood. That is why we seldom heard of any professional pianist started their training after the age of ten. 

It is not only true for musicians, it is also true in many other careers. As you still have the time to do it all over again if you mess up when you are still young. So, the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully while you are still young.
