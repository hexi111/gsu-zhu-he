Nowadays people are greatly influenced by all kinds of media which have a great number of information related with our dailly life. People are becoming more dependent on it. As a result, many people like to dress them carefully in order to catch up with fashion. In my opinion, I believe that people put too much emphsis on their personal apprearance and fashion.

First of all, many people are interested in good appearence in order to become a so-called fashionist. This attitude is encouraged by our society. Therefore, If you are people who are not interested in fashion you will be in bad situation. Nobody would like to talk with them because they do not have common topics on communication. In order to avoding such embarranced situation, people are forced to pay attention to fashion. Eventually, people are becoming like to pursue personal appearance and fashion.

Secondly, due to the influence of movie stars, many people want to have a good appearence in order to be success in the furture. Some people believe especially for women, good appearance can greatly effect their jobs, so they often go to hospital to do all kinds of surgery in order to become a beautiful person. As they espect, after certain surgery, they become popular and get well-paid.

Thirdly, some people who has good knowledge but bad appearance often cannot get good reputation. People will think they are lacking of basic knowledge on how to enjoy the life. furthermore, they will be discrimated by many people, so they will have less chance to success in the furture.   

Therefore, I believe people care too much about their personal apperance.
