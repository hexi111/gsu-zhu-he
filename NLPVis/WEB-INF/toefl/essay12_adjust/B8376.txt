According to the statement, we can notice that it brings up two different kinds of view, one says you should plan carefully while you are still young, while the other believes you should wait for "the right monents" which come up in a certain era of your lifetime. But which one is better? the answer for this question depends on your own experience and personal character. In my point of view, I'll say though we should plan our future early, but we don't have to worry too much about it. Here are my reasons below.

The first argument that can be addressed to edvelop my positon is that there is an old Chinese saying: plan never catch up with change. No matter how careful you are while you setting up your plan for the future, there are still too much uncertainties you can't control for the future. Since the world changes faster and faster than before, you can hardly find a really good way to ensure a good future.
