I agree that people care too much about their appearance today. They spend a lot of money and time on it to become fashionable.

Japan is a good example of this issue. In Japan, people spend a considerable amount of money and time for fashion and make up. Many young people work part-time for paying for cloths, bags, accessories, etc. They spend nearly 1000 US dollars per month or even more. In addition, Japanese girls spend 30 minutes to one hour for make up every morning. They make up whenever they go outside their room. They make up even when they just go to a convenience store close to house. 

The reason why Japanese people pay too much attention to appearance is that people evaluate other people's appearance and decide what kind of person she or he is from appearance, such as cloths, accessories and belongings. People think that a guy who wears a popular jacket shown in a popular fashion magazine is really cool. In contrast, they consider a guy with an out-dated watch as a weird person. In this way, people feel that they must keep up-dated with their fashion so that they won't be evaluated poorly by others.

Thus, people put too much care about appearance because they want to look cool and care about other people's eyes.
