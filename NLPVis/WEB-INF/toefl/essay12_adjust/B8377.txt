When we do something, we don't even know what is the reason we have to do this. Am I happy to do this? For me, this is a very serious issue. Many people always say" it is a must  for you to plan for your future if you want to get sucess. I agree with them due to the following reasons.

First, palning is a direction for your daily life. It is better than have nothing in your mind. we will know what to do next when we have a plan. You can easily control your dialy scheldule and go get everthing you want. For example, I usually have a plan where should I go, what train do I need to take and how long I have to be there. It sounds like having a tight schedule ,but I also have time to do other things in that day.

Second, planing can be a target for your life. Many people don't have any ideas about thier work after finishing their undergrad because they don't have any mission in their life. Some people knows a little about thier profession. They always feel bored with their job. When we ask them " Why you decide to study in the business program?"  The most response that I hear is because my family want me to do that. Fnally, most of them quit their jobs.   

To sum up, planing is very important for gaining sucess in the future. In the short run, it is good for having a paln for dialy life because we can control our time table easily.In the long run, your dream will be come true, and you will be happy with your work when you what your mission is.
