I strongly agree with this statement for a variety of reasons. As the mother of two children, I often tell my older son, who will be graduating from high school soon, to be aware of how his actions will affect his future. Both my husband and I tell him many anecdotes on why it is important to plan ahead.

My husband uses his own education as a warning against the dangers of lackadaisical planning for the future. Although he was an extremely bright student, his field of study was not one in which he would easily find a job due to an oversight in selection of post-secondary education. Although I do not believe in revision of past events, his warning is a good example of a possible result of poor planning.

Because I am an adult student, I find myself in a difficult situation with regard to my studies. I often tell my son how I envy his ability to learn and retain facts quickly and how he should apply himself to his studies more diligently. As a child, I sometimes did not pay the most attention to my studies, and now, as an adult, it is difficult for me to learn things at the pace of someone my son's age, and so I am regretting my poor study habits as a child. Because of my lack of insight as to what my present would be like, I did not concern myself in the past with how I'd live now.

Although it is impossible to change the past, I often use tales from my past to instruct my children. Many of these lessons revolve around the concept of planning for the future, and I believe greatly that it is necessary to plan for the future at an early stage in life. I know from personal experience that negative consequences can result from lack of such planning, and so I believe that the easiest path to a good future is through early and careful planning.
