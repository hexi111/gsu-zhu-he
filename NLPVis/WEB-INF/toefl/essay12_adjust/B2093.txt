When it comes to future, it is obviously hard to predict it, even though we plan our future carefully. No matter how young we started to make a plan about future, no body can quarantee that this would be the best way to go. In this sense, we cannot go in a rash and say that careful and early plan for future can fianlly give us a terrific future.

To begin with, common sense tells us that everything keeps changing in the real world, and no one can tells future no matter how smart he is. It is true that in most cases, careful and wise plan can bring us to a good result, however, there are still many cases that it turns out that good plan leads bad ending. Therefore, good plans can hardly one hundred percent quarantee good results.

Secondly, careful plan cannot ensure a good future, no matter how young we started to plan our lives. In fact, it turns out that if one plans his  future at a very young age, the chance is that he can hardly see his interest and potential abilities fully enough, which might result in a improper or even wrong plan for his future. Thus, even if we make a careful plan when we are still kids or teenagers, we can hardly say that the plan we made at that time is the best route for us to follow.

Admittedly, one must admit that to some extent it's better to make a plan than to have nothing to do. However, we can not ensure a good plan can finally bring us to a "millionair", since we must see that there are two many variable and unpredictable parameters in the real world.

In a word, we should make ourselves prepared for future, while on the other hand, we must also be prepared to the variable and unknown ending.
