I agree to the fact that nowadays people emphasise more on personal appearance and fashion. The change can be found global without any restrictions to a particular place or class of people, where peope stick to their own fashion.

Having an inherent good personal appearance is a natural gift. It has become mandatory to show a pleasant personal appearance to the world, to move onself positive with others and this is mandatory in work place. In this way, giving importance to the personal appearance is a sense of positive attitude, and is appreciated throught.

A growing emphasis on fashion can be easily identified from the steep inclination of the fashion industry like Loreal, Garnier etc. The industry has reached through the world and had received a good reception from wide class of people. It can be noted that even men products is closely coming into the race with the female fashion products. This is a sign that fashion is given an importance by both the sexes.

Apart from personal appearance, fashion is a huge money making industry. Huge amount of money is being comes through advertisements. For example, one can see from a miss world, a miss universe competition, which had tuned the entire world to the competition, creating opportunity for fashion industries. As a fact, it pulls a good looking women or men to take chances with the industry which is profitable as well a chance to become popular in the public.

More and more peope turn to fashion industry which is a fact that these industries are growing in size and revenue. Apart from huge industires, we can see small scale fashion industires like a saloon, spa growing in profits and attracting more and more people.

The conclusion is, the emphasis on a good personal appearance and changing to modern fashion blends with people interests which can be clearly seen from the growing industries in fashion making.
