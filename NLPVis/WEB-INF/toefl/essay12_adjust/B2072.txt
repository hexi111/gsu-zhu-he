Although many believe that if a person starts to plan something earlier, he or she can ensure a good future, the ground of this claim is not very solid. Only prophets can predict the future. Most of us have to way to envision what is going to happen in ten years. Just take New Year resolutions for example, the list that many of us rack brains to make on the New Year eve, how many of them have been fulfilled? How important it is to our success in the year?

No future is ensured. No plan is perfect. To carefully plan a life that we do not have much control is meaningless. It only makes people regret in melancholy when they cannot live in that way. I have found that courage and action weight more than plans and pledges. In review of many people stories of success, we can see that they live to be great not because of their adolescent plans, but because of their bold and timely action. They are the risk takers. They know what they need to do at the right moment, even though it is different path from what they have planned. When Gauguin was young, he planned to become a stake dealer, but when he discovered his talent in art, he didn’t hesitate to leave his secured job and pursue a different life in Tahiti. When today we admire this genius for his great influence in impressionism, how many of us know that he made the decision to life an artistic life when he was a middle-aged man?

There is really no need to worry about forties or fifties when one is still young. One always has many opportunities to embrace success in his or her life. The best thing one can do is to live to the fullest and enrich himself, so when z chance comes, he is prepared.
