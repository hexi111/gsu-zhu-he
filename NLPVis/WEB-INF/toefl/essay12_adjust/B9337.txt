I totally agree with this statement, yet I think it's difficult to implement. It is very important for everyone to plan for their future while they are still young so as to take the necessary steps towards achieving their goals. Time is so valuable and wasting it can have serious implications on one's future and career and what he/she aspires to do with their lives. 

However, it's difficult to know what one really wants to become or achieve in this life. It takes time to discover our skills and potential and sometimes one could spend a lot of time in a certain field, then realizes that this is not what he/she really wants. In this case, change becomes a hard step as one might feel that he/she lost a big portion of his/her life doing something that they didn't love and they might convince themselves that it is not worth it to change what they are doing after such a long time. 

In addition, the demands of the market usually affect people's choices in targeting specific careers. For instance, one might plan that he/she wants to pursue a certain goal, yet when they grow up they realize that it might not be the best career because the market demands otherwise. So people sometimes have to alter their plans and goals to accommodate with the market of their country as it would be devastating to spend an extensive amount of time and effort trying to pursue a certain degree then after graduation one finds out that there is no demand for his/her degree.
