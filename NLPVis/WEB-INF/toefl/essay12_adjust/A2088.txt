The community nowadays has a big impact on influences from various fashion style and appearance. students and teenagers are amoung those who keep tracks on the latest fashion and compares it peer to peer. However, This issue broght up the question of whether the the amount of emphasis we have on personal appearance and fashion produces any impact.

Personally, I disagree on the statement. Personal appearance is the main factor that impacts the first impression on the people you meet. The appearance you choose to have basicly reflects your personality. Besides that, dressing up also shows respect to the occasion and also to your peers who travels with you. For example, an interview with a company that u wish to work for needs to have a proper dress code and also an appealing appearance that gives the interviewer a good impression on you. 

Besides that, people tend to spend a lot on fashion. By keeping track on the latest fashion, people loves to own clothes and accesories they think is fashionable and new. However, the amount of money spent on fashion are acceptable. Keeping track of the latest trend and buying fashionable clothes are one hobby that leads to a lot of joy. Despite the money spent on it, the rest of the result are just Happiness and the feeling of satisfaction.

Therefore, i disagree that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion as the pros seems to beat the cons. Hence, emphasizing on personal appearance and fashion isn't a negative conception afterall.
