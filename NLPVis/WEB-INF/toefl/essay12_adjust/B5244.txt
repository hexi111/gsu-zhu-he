Planning ahead can always be a positive factor to ensure a good future. But I personally feel that everything cannot be planned well in advance and we have to take life as it comes. Everyday is a new experience and we cannot be 100% sure about what is going to happen next moment.

First of all, we will not have the complete picture of what we want few years later. Though planning for near future might help in designing better future, it will not always solve all problems. We should always be ready to take any day as it comes as every day has its own surprises and surprises is a good thing. Otherwise our lives would be monotonous and dull, if we could guess everything that will happen next time. 

Second, we all know that spontaneous quality is very important in anyone's life. It helps us to deal with any extremity or situations. Its always better to be prepared to deal with whatever happens future .

Thirdly, if a person always plans life ahead and needs  guidelines, he gets used to that habit and cannot operate without it. If we always act according to plan like robots then we cannot handle any new situation . This could cause a huge problem in life. Being prepared to handle anything is a good thing. 

Fourthly, we must have a balanced life with enough planning and direction to lead us to our goals.  We should always be ready with a vague ideas or plans to handle things but not rely or depend on it 100% that it creates void in life. Being organised and planned can help in attaining goals and saves time. 

To sum up, a careful balance of planning and being ready to accept life as it comes is always a good thing. We must know where we are heading in life and have some ideas about our future. But anything in excess can have a negative impact. So spending sometime on planning about our lives can help us in a big way and define a good future.
