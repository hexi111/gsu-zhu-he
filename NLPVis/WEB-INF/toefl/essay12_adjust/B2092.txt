Everyone would dreamed about a perffect future since they were young. Some people said that you can have a better future if you plan it well. Do you agree or disagree? In my openion, I agree. Why would I agree with it?

First of all, if we can plan for our future earlier, we can have a main fram of the way we are going to go. And we can have more preparetion for it. For example, if I plained to have a TOEFL test in a few monthes, I can start to prepare for the TOEFL test as early as possible. Therefore, we can espact a better score from a better preparetion.

Second of all, since we have known the things that might happen in the future, we can prepare for the most worse situation. For instant, if we are planning for 
a outdoor picnic, we would also prepare a indoor place incase it is raining. So that we won't be disturbed by the rain.

Anyway, it is always better to do things with more preparetions then nothing. We can decrease our lost by increase our preparetion. Therefore, I agree that we can have a better future with a carefully plan.
