There are a lot of way to ensure a good future for yourself. Some of parents make whole plan for their children while they are young. I understand it as they want to ensure their children's good future. However, I believe that is not only best way. Because even though they make a plan carefully by themselve or parents while they are young, there are a lot of posibility to not make it success. 

Everyone has a similar experience that keep changig your mind of what you want to become while your are young. Even though you knew that what you want to become, it doesn't mean that you always can do it. I also have thhese kind of experience by myself and throgh friends. One of my friend, she made a whole plan to become a musicion while she was young. It was a perfect plan and she did whatever she seted up. By the way, after she got into college she changed her mind. So, she is studing for art right now. As you can see, while people growing up, they see more bigger world. This means, even if you made a perfect plan when you were young, there  are a lot of chance to change of mind. It is not only change the mind but also other reasons could be.

If someone who had a perfect plan and followed the plan for the whole life. Howver, somewhat reason made the person failed it. If this is happened there is not many way to survive
