Did  you have a very clear goal for your futhure when you were a child ? If you ask me this question, I will say Yes without thinking. But waite, after saying Yes , I will find it should be No. I guess many people will react as I do, because most of us began dreaming our futhur when we were every young, but few of us fullfill the the first dream at last. Does it because we didn't plan it carefully? No, we failed  because our goals changed as we grew up. Most of the times, even though we plan very carelly for our futhure, the results are often out of control at last.

My reason is that  if you plan your futhure too early, you will lose the chance to experience many things that might be more suitale for you. For instance, a Chinese student who is studying Art and Design in America once was a bad student in high school  in china. But now, he gain scholarship every year , and he is the best student in his university. His father is a teacher in one of  the best university in China. The father hoped that boy could be a good student in science in the futhure, so he had been trained to be a traditional good student when he was child. However, when this boy entered the high school, his talktive and his interests in drawing became his bad habit in most of the teachers' eyes. They thought he should be more silence and spend more time on  studying. He tried to follow the way his father and all the other teacher hoped  he go. But, finally he failed. Fortunenately, he fullfill his drawing dream in the United States. Here, all the teacher thinks he a excerlent student, because he needn't follow the designed path for his life, he can do whatever he is intrested in .

From the above mentioned example, we see that the best way to  ensure a good future for yourself is not  to plan carefully while you are still young but to follow your own interests.
