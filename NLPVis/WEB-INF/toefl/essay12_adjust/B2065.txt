One of the most popular words nowadays among undergraduates is future plan. Lots of semiar in university are about how to make a suitable plan for students’ future life. In most people’s opinion, decide what you should do or would like to do in the future as soon as possible  can definitely guarantee a better life than peers. They believe that only you realize what to do in the future can you concentrate all of your energy and money on the right things which may helpful for your future work. For example, if a man want to be a scientist, he should take some courses and grasp the technical which can benefit his future research. After all, the energy of a person is limited, they should take the most usage of it.  

I hold an opposite opinion with this view. I think a right decision can only be make when experienced a lot of things. How can a person decide what he should do in a hurry just followed the parents and teachers suggestion? Interesting is the best teacher through human beings whole life, we should experience more and grasp more knowledge  and then to make a final decision what we should do in the future. Or when you finally realize that you have to be an artist other than scientist, you may waste a lot of time in your life. 

In one word, future plan is very important in people’s life, however, when to make your blueprint is depending on your own experience. So we  must analyse it from case to case.
