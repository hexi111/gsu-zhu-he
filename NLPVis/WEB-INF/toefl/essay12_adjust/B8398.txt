There are two reasons why I believe we should make a good future  plan while we are young. 

Firstly, in order to accomplish our goal, we need to make a plan in advance and approach to the goal 
little by little. There is a proverb "Rome doesn't build only one day".  It takes a lot of time to get a good future.  Without imagining your future plan, we are unable to ensure  a good future.  For example, I did not think about any future plan when I was a child, actually, I did not learn to think about it.  Consequently, I could not decide what I wanted to do in a future and even now, I have been struggling with my future plan. I cannot decide what I want to do. I feel that was a big mistake. I believe I should not do that mistake again for my children. 

Secondly, if we make a good future plan after getting older, we need more energy. Needless to say, adult people have more experience than children.  Therefore, adult people try to use their brain more and tend to be conservative and try to protect our own style. 
In the end, adult people generally start thinking "it is too late to do something for me.. " Children do not have so much experience. Therefore, they have more flexibility to accept their new goal and future plan. There is a potential for them. 

As a result of the two reasons above, I strongly recommended to make a good future plan while we are young. I would do that for my children. and for myself, I am trying to learn how to make a future plan little by little.
