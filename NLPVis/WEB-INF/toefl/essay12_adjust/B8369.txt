Most people when they are young don't plan for the future. Like the old saying say "You are not promised tomorrow, live for the day". Many people seems to live by this saying for most of their lifetime. Young people don't undertans the meaning to plan for they future. They worried more about today and not tomorrow's satisfaction. They make stupid mistakes and don't plan accordingly. The best way to ensure a future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. 

Take a college student for example. A college student will be offered tons of credit cards applications in their first year of collge by various banks.  Now being that they worry more about today not tomorrow satisfaction, he or she will likely apply for a credit card. not only they will get approved, but they use it unsparingly. They will buy so many thing they don't need for most of their time in college living tham in debt when they gradute.  Being in debt will ruin most of your future purchasing plans when entering adulthood. Its good to know how to plan you spending and saving at a younger age so you can live happily as an adult.

Therefore, its good to plan carefully when you are young rather than living with no plans. Those mistakes will catch up to you later in life, as an adult. You will be able to overcome those obstacles, but it will be a long and enduring  path to recovery, because simply you didn't plan carefully when you were young.
