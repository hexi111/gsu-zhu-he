I strongly agree the the statement that we should plan carefully whie we are still young. I used to serve in an after-shool program and teach kindergarten and elementary school students aged between 3 to 12 years old. For those elementary shool students, all of them went to their regular official schools before they came to the after-school program. After talking to their parents in person or on the phone, I found that most of them put a lot of effort planning for their children's future and were afraid that they might not be able to be comparable enough to oher people after they grow up.  It is a very common thing that happens to almost 90 percent of families now in Taiwan. Simply looking at the phonomenon, we can conclude that people do put the idea, starting early bringing up success, into their consideration.
     
As time passes by, we find that more and more people receive higher education. More and more people set up plans for their future as they are still young. It is reasonable to assumed that, the early you prepare yourself, the more successful you can be. A famous pitcher, Chen-Ming Wang, who plays for the Yankess now, found himself mesmerized by baseball and started to practice when he was just 10 years old. Now he has become Yankee's ace and am respected by people in Taiwan and Yankee's fans in New York. After reading the autobiography of his, I concluded that the statement that planning carefully while we are still young is definite ture.
