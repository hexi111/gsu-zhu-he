Many times parents or senial people say planing future is very important to have good future. Beside, some people say we have to plan when we are young. I strongly agree with the first part, planing carefully for future, but I don't agree with the second part, planning when we are young. If we have very sepesific plan, we can have oviouse goal. Moreover the actual goal can give huge power for fowarding ahead to people. Any person can plan carefully for future no matter what their ages.

First of all, specific plan give oviouse goal to people, and the person who has a plan can go to the goal easily. There is a very famouse lawyer in Korea, his name is Go Seung-Duck. He became a lawyer when he was young. He said he is not smart. However he made a plan to be a lawyer very carefully, such as how many pages he had to read in a day, how can save time for studying, how many times he will study in a day or how long he will spend time for meal. After he made his plan, he just followed the plan. Finally he became a laywer as young, and he could be succeful person.

Second, the age for making a plan carefully and following the plan is not important. The meaning of future is unhappend day. Ten years later is future, and tomorrow is also future. This means even thought someone is 60 years old, he/she can make a plan to have good trip with his/her wife or husband in next year. In their point view, having a good time with wife or husband is good future. 

Many grown up people say making a plan carefully when we are young can give good future. I believe half of the sentance is right, and half of the sentance is wrong. The one of the point being successeful person is making a sepecific plan, but even though old people can make a plan for their future.
