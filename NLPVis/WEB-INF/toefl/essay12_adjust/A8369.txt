All over the world people are primarily judged base on physical appearance and the way they dress. It dictates our life by the way we walk, talk and socialize with each other. Having certain physical features and the way we dress represent how we are to be treated in society and how we are not to be treated. People put too much emphasis on physical appearance and fashion because it's a way of advertising themselves to society.

Nowadays people spend too much time worrying about what shoes to put on. Why is that so important? Well, simply a well dress person is looked at being someone who is smart, educated and wealthy. Therefore, many people spend most of their time and money to be like one of those people. They purchase all the latest brands no matter the cost just to live in that "life" for a moment. Take a look at the average teenagers for example. Most of them know when the new Michael Jordan shoe is coming out rather than focusing on education. They spend most of their money buying clothes, shoes, and jewelry rather than investing in something that last for a good period of time. Fashion is growing everyday so clothing brands that good now won't be in the next few years.

People put too much emphasis on physical appearance and fashion because how they advertise themselves to the world. The way we dress dictates our lifestyles ans social status. Therefore people strive so hard to attain those physical features and lifestyles depicted on television, billboards, internet and in movies. It hard to avoid it when its in your face all the time. It's something we can't avoid but simply to indulge in it.
