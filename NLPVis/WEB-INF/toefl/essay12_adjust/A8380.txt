As the auther says, people nowadays put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  I agree with the author. The reasons are as follows.

To begin with,  there are more and more medias in every country nowadays.  Newpapers, magazines, tv programs, and even news are talking about what celebrities wear, what celebrities ues, and how they look.  Because of the playing of these news, people will think that they want to be look like a celebrities.

Second, there are more and more luxury brands introduced to the people nowdays.  All comments about these luxury products tend to be positive and encourage people to buy these luxury products.  People will feel that luxury products with big brand names represent beauty and fashion.  Thereforee, when peoplee judge someone will think much about what he/she wear, what he/she use, and how he/she look like rather than think about his/her personality.

However, the most important thing of a person is not personal appearance and fashion.  It is personality makes the value of a person.  Due to the playing of the news, people tend to think a person as what he/she look like.  It is not fair to people who used to wear casually, then other people will consider them as not fashion or not wealthy.  It is also inappariate that people will think a person is fashoin just because his/her appearance.

To sum up, people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  It will make people to confused with the value a person.
