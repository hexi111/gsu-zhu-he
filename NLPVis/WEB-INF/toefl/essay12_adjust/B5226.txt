I disagree with this statement and I think that best way to ensure a good future for your self is not to plan very carefully while you are young, but is to study enough knowledge to prepare yourself for the future, and make the right decision when you are need to choose.

Fist of all, you have no experience for the society and how to build a carrer when you are young, so you are not sure you can make the reasonable plan. While you are in high school or in college, you might already read some books about succeed people and some stories about heros. But, those stories can not make sure you can success in the same way. Bill gates wanted to pursue his undergraduate at the very begining, but after a while he found he can not miss the chance to build up the computer operation systems. Then he succeeded which is not his original plan.

Moreover, if one make a plan when he is very young, he might constraint himself in a very narrow area. I don't doubt most successful people focus a specific area, but as I know, most famous scientists didn't know what exactly he would find later, and after a period of research, he found his interest and area. 

In modern society, science and techlonogy develops at an even faster pace. No one can predict very exactly what will happen in the future, and no one can say he doesn't need to learn from others. So fit yourself to the social needs is the smartest way in my mind.

I have to say I don't mean insistance is not good. Insistance is very important for all success. 

Let me draw a conclusion, if you want to ensure a good future, you need to have enoug knowledge, skills and the ability to fit yourself to the sociecial needs. Small plans are necessary, but very detailed plan might constraint your success.
