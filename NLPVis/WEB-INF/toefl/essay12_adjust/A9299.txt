When we open a magazine, we can see all kinds of advertisements about cosmetics and fashion companies. People nowadays are putting more and more emphasis on personal appearance, especially in cosmopolitan cities, such as New York, LA, Hong Kong, Tokyo etc. 

There are studies about personal appearance relating to job searching. And evidence proves that better appearance will enhance the opportunity for getting employed. As the living standards of people gradually improve, people are not satisfied with human's basic needs. We look for more fashionable clothings which will also enhance our self-confidence. 

When the people in a country put a lot of emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, it is a good sign. Because it means the people are rich enough to afford fashion, and they don't need to worry about war or other social instabilities. And that will also help building up a image of civilized and well-educated people in the country. 

Development of the fashion, cosmetics and other industries relating to personal appearance will also promote the financial development of a country. The labs of the cosmetics companies have a lot of experiments everyday trying to enhance their skin care or make-up products. Fashion companies hire a lot of designers. All of these creates more job opportunites for the people.
