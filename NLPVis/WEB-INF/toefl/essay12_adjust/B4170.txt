The meaning of "good future" really depends on person. Some people know what they want to do or be when they grow up even they are still very young. But others, they struggle to figure out or do not care. And there are even some people who are not sure about their future.

You need to be rich or informed about the world enough when you think about your future. Especially in the industrial countries like I am, it's nothing special to think about own future. The sons of senitors often knows they are going to be like their fathers, and they or their family plan their caliculums to be the future senitor which you will study for. 

Not so many people are born in such families. Some are born in poor families and others in middle class. Even thuogh they present their future in the elementary school, they probably forget soon. And later as they become high school students, teachers will ask them what their plans are after the graduation. Now they think about college or not.  


The children in the country where the war is going on, they are even not sure about their tomorrow. First they have to survive and hoping the peace will come soon. For them, the "good future" might be the end of the war. It is out of control and only thing they can do is to survive and take care of themselves. 

 The "good future" means different for each person and sometimes out of control. However, I believe that  there's something in common for everyone. If you make efforts, such as studying to be a business man or survinving to see the end of war, there will be some point they will feel satisfied. You might not have good furtunes to be what you want to be easily and it might be very hard you nealy die. However, once you gave up, there won't be the future you've expected. You can carefully plan your future or you can be flexible as much as you can for your good future.
