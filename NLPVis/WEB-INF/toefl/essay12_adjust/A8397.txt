I agree that Nowadays "some" people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion but it does not mean everyone.

Because of the technology, we can get informations from television, newspapers, magazines, and internet much eazier than before. As the result, nowadays people usually have their own opinions on everything. Even children, they want to decide what to waer and what to do by themselves. And some people may do special things to show up themselves. I think hat is why we will feel some people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

I must say that we always notice the things that different from us or normal. Therefore,if you look around, you may think many people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. But if you look more carefully, you will find out there are more people on the normal track.
