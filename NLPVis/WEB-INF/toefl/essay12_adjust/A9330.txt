Very often, as soon as we turn on the TV, the comercial that pops out is one introducing to you some make-up, beauty, or hairdressing products.  It seems for some people to  ponder on this question: Do people put too mcuh exampasis on their personal appearance and fashion. 
    
Most people will come up with the answer: yes, which meets my expectation on the quetsion. I believe we all have the experience: when we go to class, it is granted that we wear make-up, dressed nicely with hair groomed in a fashion style. Otherwise, it would be considered impolite.  Frazzled hair and a pale face are seldom seen in the context of public areas. 
    
Walking on the street with friends, yongsters search for some store that feature fashionable or luxury clothes and shoes to shop. Outfits that costs above 500 dolars can be sold out in one day as long as they come from famous designers' hands.  However, a lot of times, after they purchase those beautiful and stunning clothes home, it is very possible that they store them in the wardrobe and they are never worn by the owners expcept on the day they were bought.
   
It is clear that people do pay too much attention or too much time on their appearance and fashion.
