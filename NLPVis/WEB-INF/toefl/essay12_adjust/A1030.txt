I disagree with the statement that there is too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Although there are excessive advertisements that try to persuade onlookers to emphasize appearance, I find that people often dress down on a daily basis.

Although fashion will always be a part of consumer trends, people today are often too busy to worry about how they look in their daily activities. Bustling life calls for simpler and more comfortable clothing, and because life is more hectic everyday, personal appearance and fashion are following the trend accordingly.

For comparison's sake, take the middle of the twentieth century as an example. Men and women were often seen with clean, elegant fashion and appearance. Men were often void of facial hairs, and hair were often slicked back. Women kept up with elegance by having fancy hair-dos and rigorous posture. Today, it is commonplace to find unkempt men and women in almost all aspects of life.

Although the means for a cleaner outlook (appearance- and fashion-wise) are widely available more than ever, people do not utilize these materialistic means to place emphasis on their personal appearance nor fashion.
