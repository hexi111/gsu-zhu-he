In my opinion, it is essential to plan for the future at an early stage. Most adolescents feel at a loss about what to do in their career life because they never take it into a careful consideration but idle around while young. A good academic performance doesn't necessarily guarantee a bright future if students don't cultivate their interests in their favored field of area.

How could  students effectively plan their future? Besides hard-working in school studies, they should make good use of time attending various extracurricular activities. Their leadership or courage to survive in the wild may be trained in a scout club. Their competence in computer facilities could be reinforced when they learn how to demonstrate a presentation in a speech club. When joining these activities, they are more likely to know where they take interest in. 

It is also a good opportunity for students to accumulate working experiences through taking part-time jobs. As a secretary, she could benefit from the interaction with her boss, knowing how to make adjustments to achieve the job's expectations. As a saleman, he could gradually refine the skill of how to deal with clients' complaints. As a pizza deliveryman, he could understand  the reponsibilty of satisfying the customers' needs no matter rain or shine. It is beneficial for students to have a picture of what his future career may look like.

"What do you want to be in the future? " If you want to obtain a good job or ensure an ideal life, it's never too late to start. Set up a clear goal adp for your potential or interests, try every possible way to achieve it.
