Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.


I agree with this statement. Nowadays almost everybody in the Western World has television and/or internet, so it is easy to get acces to other people lives and to watch how other people live and act. 
For example, music has always been popular and now it is easier then ever to get acces to all the artists that live around the world. Thus, youth in China can see how the artists in the Unites States are acting, what they are wearing and how they look. 
And by seeing that, they start to imitate their favorite artists and therefore put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

Another example that can be mentioned is the rise of the plastic surgery clinics. A few years ago, only people like Pamela Anderson engaged in plastic surgery operations, but nowadays, regular people do it as well and it has almost become so common and normal as going out to dinner.
A reason for this occurance might be that the woman think they will get more attention by doing it, or another reason might be that their man look at better looking woman, what makes them unsecure and that they think their man will pay attention to them again if they engage in plastic sergury. 

My third and last example that supports my believe comes from the different magazines one can buy. Almost in each and every magazine there are good looking people on the cover and inside the magazine. No wonder that other people start believing that they should look like that as well. 

So my personal opinion is that the media puts more and more pressure on people to look good and think about personal appearance and fashion. And emphasis is put especially on young girls. And as is looks for now, the media is going to expand its influence and even more and more emphasis will be put on personal appearance and fashion.
