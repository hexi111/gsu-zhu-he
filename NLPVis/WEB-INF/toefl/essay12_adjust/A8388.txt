It is a kind of issue around the world,there are more and more people seem care too much in their appearance and fashion,not only the women but also the men.Since media and advisiting have beenexgerate how beauty is important in these days,and encourage people to accept plastic surgery.In my opinion,I think that people should put less attention on their appearance and fashion.

Hower I believed that inside of a person is much important than outside of a person,there are many reason that I supported for.Itisthat people focus on their appearance too much,they must felt empty in the end.Because fashion cannot satisify a person's heart.There are still another beautiful things which are valuable to explore them.for example,books ,music and movies that must be good if people don't pay too much attention on fashion.

Due to advirtising and media around oustoo much,so people cannot stop talking and thinking fashion stuff.I think that people put less attention on this stuff,most people must have a healther and happier lives.
