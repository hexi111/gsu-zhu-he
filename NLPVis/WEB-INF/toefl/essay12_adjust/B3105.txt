The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.  Thinking ahead always benifits yourself.  In high school, students are allowed to take any kind of subjects which students themseleves are interested in after they finished taking all the basic requirements.  For example, if you were interested in being an accountant, you could take accounting course.  If you were interested in being an interior designer, you could take interior design class.  There are many choices for students to plan ahead for their future.  The first two years of college life is another way for students to plan for their futures.  Students could get into their intended fields to experience the topics which their intended future career will be involved.  It is always better to choose your major earlier and get involved in it more during your early years.  My friend, Tina, is 23 years old now, and she is still a junior college student.  The reason which keeps her in college for so many years is that she changed her major for three times.  Time is always vaulable.  We can never get passed time back.  People should always think more about their future and get them started early, so that time would not be wasted.
