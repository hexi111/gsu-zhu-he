Nowadays people put a lot of emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. It is a controversial and complicated issue. Some people believe that we should not put so much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. Others assert that personal appearance and fashion, the first image of person, should be emphasized very much. In my opinion, I would like to say that we should put so much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Here come several critical reasons to support my ideas.

First of all, the reason to reinforce my position is that personal apperance and fashion is the first image of every one. You have to put more attention on your appearance and fashion. It would not be polite that you put on improper clothes to attend an appointment. For example, if you wear a T-shirt to join the formal meeting, it will be offensive to the host. It will leave a bad first image to other people. 

Indeed, according to my experience, people do not put too mach emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Some people who are working in the entertainment business may put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. However, it is their job. They have to put more attentions in order to lead the fasion of people. That is why I do not think that people do not put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

Finally, judging from the ideas given in the aforementioned paragraphs, the result is so obvious. The reasons are so solid that we have no doubt about the conclusion. Therefore, I can come to the most reasonable conclusion that people do not put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
