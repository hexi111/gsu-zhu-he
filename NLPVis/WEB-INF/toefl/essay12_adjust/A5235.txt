I am firmly in agreement with this statement. As an adult in a college setting, I get an unusual opportunity to analyze my environment from an aloof standpoint, and one of the first things I observed about popular culture is that people rely too much upon appearance as a basis for action. Furthermore, the media is flooded with images, and to quote a common expression, "A picture is worth a thousand words." This clearly shows the power of appearance from society's overemphasis on it.

My son is one of few people who do not seem too concerned about his appearance. He considers haircuts to be a hassle, and he often wears socks with holes in them or forgets to tuck his pockets back into themselves when they come out. He also slouches a lot when walking around. I habitually rectify his behaviors and carelessness, but this correction stems from hoping for him to be accepted in society, which becomes more difficult if he comports himself in such a bizarre and unattractive manner.

I often "surf" the web as well, to read news and such, especially about my home country, because such information is hard to come by in other means here. When on the World Wide Web, I notice many banners in numerous websites, some of them with certain scantily clad females with great physiques to attract customers. Also, when watching the academy awards, I notice that the fashion of the guests is always a matter discussed when the actors are arriving. In the supermarket, magazines discussing fashion and apparel are quite numerous. And, of course, there are entire sections of supermarkets dedicated to products of enhancing one's appearance.

It is no lie that appearance is important, because vision is such an important part of life to a large portion of humans. However, society places too much emphasis on appearance, an emphasis which is shown in the various items of modern life.
