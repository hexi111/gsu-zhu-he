I do not agree with the above statment which says people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I do not agree with these statement for for two reasons. First of all, it is not the way you look or the clothes you dreesed up defines  you who you are, but they way you think. Secondly Fashion is somting that is not permanent so people should not depending on it. 

Before we we look at the persons appearance we have things to concider, these if one person look beautiful/handsome from thier outside, they might be very different from thier inside. In other word, people have different way of thinking. On the other side if someone is beautiful it does not mean he/she is smar enough. so most of the time people are mistaken while electing thier candidate or president. They only chose becuase he/she is good looking but he might be smart enough to lead the country and the society. 

Additionally, fashion is the things come one time and dissapear in one time. Those pople who  judges others they way they dressed up or keep up with the fashions have a mistaken idea of others. Some people want to follow the fashion but they might not have money, and also some people they do not like to spend their money on fashion they ruther spend on someting on need. People shoud cosider of things in need before they put too much emphasis on fashoin. 

In conclusion I have opposite idea for those people who put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion becuse, what defines us what we do and our perspective toward the society. Addtoinally fasion is not someting we should not worry about because it is meaningless and someting not in need.
