Should we plan our future carefully while we are still young? I think the answer is not just "yes" or "no" in this question. It should be dependand on the satuation.

Firstly, if somebody has a special talen in some area, it willbe a good thing to plan his or her future while he or she is young. because many skill, like sports, should be trand earlier. Tiger Woods is a good example. His father finded out his talen and started training him when his still young.  

On the other hand, not everybody can become Tiger Woods even they be traind like him. We always say that in Chinese: pig never bark like dog. It mean that everyone is different from another even you do everything the same.

In my opinion, consider your satuation before you plan your future is more important. You will have good future if you plan carefully, not matter how old are you.
