Somebody think it is very far away to consider your future because the evironment around you always change with the time. On the contrary, other people dream a good future, and make a good plan to realize their dream. For my oppinion, I hold on the best way to ensure g good future for myself is to plan it carefully.

Firstly, you will work hard if you have a dream of good future, also a plan can give you a direction. You will arrange your energy and time approriately in order to attain your goals. Without plan, it is equal to run without a destination, and you never know how and when you have done enough. So I always think the plans are good start to people who want to have a good future.

Secondly, making a plan not only help you to make improvement, but also give you more chances to success. Before you make this plan, you will consider it for a while, and estimate your ability if you can do it. Such kink of thinking actually offer you a good opportunity to realize yourself what you can do and what you can get. So, once you have made a plan, the percent of success will quite high.

At last, the considerate plan can encourage you when you fell upset and desperate. Not everyone can realize their dream. The good thing is that you can make some plans so that you can change your plan quickly to another plan once you find this one doesn't work for you. Sometimes, a lot of people have no any idea about what to do next when they failed. If you have think about your plan carefully, it means you have already thought the situation of failure. Then you will know how do do with that at the time that you really met it. So you still have hope and encourage to face up to future.

At a summary, I think a plan should be made carefully if you want to ensure a good future for yourself.
