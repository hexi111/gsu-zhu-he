I totally agree that nowadays people put too much emphasis on their own appearance and fasion. There are three main reasons. One is that people always want to be unique in the world and concern too much of themselves. The second reason is that  personal appearance affects one's everyday life and work. The third reason is that our commercial advertisements drives this trend.

From psychological view, man wants to be different from others in order to gets more attention. Emphasis on personal appearance reflects that people want to be the focus of the crowd, thus to become self-confident. On the other hand, we want to be unique so as to enjoy ourselves. Fashon is one way to attain that goal.

Personal appearance also affect our life, our work and so on. Personal appearance and fashion is the first sight when you meet a strange. Nowadays people  are used to judging a guy from his fashion. If he is dressed in expensive clothes, then we believe he is very rich and in high class. From this point, people can earn others' respect by way of their fashion.

The third reason is that our commercial companies bring too many colorful and successful advertisements through various ways. As a result, people have many choices and want to catch up with the up-=to-date fashion. Personal appearance and fashion become a hot topic among people.

However, I argue that people shouldnot stress too much on their personal appearance and fashion. The main reason is that people can win success and respect from inner part instead of outer part. The merit within the people are long lasting and more valuable than the merit embodied by the appearance and fashion.

In a word, nowadays people emphasize much more on their own appearance than necessary.
