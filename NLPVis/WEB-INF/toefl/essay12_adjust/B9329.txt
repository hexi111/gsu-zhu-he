The statement suggests that if people have planned their future when they are young, they will definitely have a good future. I agree with the statement that it's necessary to have a complete plan before doing things. However, I doubt the direct relationship between planning early and the absoluteness of getting good future. 

The concept of "getting prepared early" is prevalent. But Therefore, parents and teachers would encourage their children or students to learn as much knowledge as possible. It's also the reason why there are so many cram schools in Taiwan. Parents want their children to start earlier than others, so they can learn more and they can have better future. They have planned the future for their children. But do those whose parents have planned for them when they are young really have a good future? 

In my opinion, the best way to ensure a good future is to know what you really want when you are young, then make a plan, and go for it. It's useless to have a plan that is your parents' plan instead of yours. So young people should know clearly what they really want to be in the future. In addition to the plan, one should also really know haw to put their plan into practice. If you don't do something, a plan is a only a plan, no matter how carefully it is planned. 

To conclude, everyone should have their own goal, and make a plan for the goal, and go for it. Motivation speaks louder than plans. Once you have a strong intention to achieve your goal in the future, you will definitely have a good future.
