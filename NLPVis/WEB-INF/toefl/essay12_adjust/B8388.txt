There is no doubt that the young people will plan their future which is good for them.I totally agreed that.Because be a sucessful person that have to take a lot of tiome to work hard and preare his plan.It seems nothing would coming if a person doen't try hard.I have some point to follow my idea.
firt of all,the childhood is a imprtant stage for everyone,because the stage could develop a person's personality and talent.It might be good if a person know what he want in his early life.Besides he can look for more opportunites for himself.

The second,a chance that may lead a person to success,if a person doesn't prepare well in his early age,he possibily lose his chance to success.Hower,a person have to ensure his plan and prepare well when a chance is coming.

Final,It must have a key to a sucessful way,That is plan carefully when people make some important decision.I believed that if you want to get sucess that you have to think carefully,because make a perfect plan that might have  a carefully thought.Both of them are connected.

In my opinion,I truely believed that a person has prepared his plan in a early age.The sooner you prepare,the better life you have.Further,I also use the thought to inspire people around me.
