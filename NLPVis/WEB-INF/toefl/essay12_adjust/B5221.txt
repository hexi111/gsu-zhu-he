Ensuring a good future is one of the most important tasks any young person should think about.  By doing so, you will probably make more reasonable and sound decisions about your future goals than if you have to make them in a rush.

There are decisions related to almost every aspect in life.  Decisions related with your future career, for example, will impact your whole lifetime.  Then the need for a careful and planned decision regarding this aspect is necessary if you plan to succeed in life.

Based on the decision you make about your future career, you will probably have to choose an appropriate academic program at school that can help you to achieve your career goals.  Making a wrong decision in regard to your academic major might lead to having to rethink your goals or, even worse, starting from scratch.  There have been cases of students who began an academic program without considering their true potential, an even their likes and dislikes, and who ended up doing something they did not like  carrying within themselves a hard feeling of frustration.

As a general principle you should avoid procrastination in this aspect.  Making decisions about what you will be doing in the  future well in advance will widen the possibilities of success.  Success translated in terms of doing what you like, getting paid for your full potential, working with people who also love what they do, and last but not least, peace of mind for you and your family.
