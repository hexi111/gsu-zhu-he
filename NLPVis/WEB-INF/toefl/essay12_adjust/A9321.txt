It is true that nowadays more and more people put much emphasis on personal looks or fasionion. However, as a good saying goes, "Never judge a person by his appearance." Though it is natural to be attracted by a good-looking person, good appearance doesn't represent sincerity, faithfulness, willing to help when people are in need, which are all important properties of how to construct a lasting relationship.

When  I was young, I craved for a handsome guy who could propose to me with a sparkling diamond. How romantic it is if I could be pursued by a famous super star with fabulous looks. Not until I met my boyfriend did  I realize how important it was to meet someone who really understands how you feel, who is glad to share joy or sorrow and who always thinks on your side. Even he is plain-looking, he could bring the largest wealth in the world- a wholehearted love that can't be replaced by the superficial role of money. 

Undoubtedly, trying to keep attractive to catch up the fashion is what most youngsters do nowadays. To draw public attention. they wear the most popular clothes or listen to the hittest music to shape their individual style. Wisdon matters more than outer looks.  While in the pursuit of good appearance, we should try to nourish our inner world by extensive reading, which can broaden our vision. Will you get along with a pretty girl wihout fruitful knowledge or a big heart in a long period of time? Accordingly, we should emphasize more on how a person treats his friends around rather on how fasinating his look is. After all, a person with good looks doesn't guarantee sincerity.
