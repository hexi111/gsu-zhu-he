I agree this statement. Actually, with the fast developing speed of the whole world, people begin to put much emphasis on personal appearnce and fashion.

people wants give public a good expression, so first they emphasize on their apperance and fashion. Because those two are the first expression in people mind. they wants to do better and better, and make others appreciate them.

Their is good evidence to prove that people put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. For the good appearance, at the beginng, people use the makeup to change their faces.  But with the teconology developing, people start to make an operation for their faces and other parts of their body.

To the fashion, the desingers come up with their good ideas, and they make lots of beutiful fashion. Then people want them not to behind to others, they puchase the popular style fashion. Therefore, they put much money and attentaion on the fashion. For this point, we can get the evidence from the cost of buying the fashion survey to know that really people do that. 

In the morden society, we can see the different styles and beutiful clothes when we walk on the way. Especially in the big mall and market, there will be so many people buy the clothes, eventhough sometimes they do not need that cloth.

In a conclusion,according to those suituations, we can know that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
