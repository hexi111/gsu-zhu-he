Once a person was born, it seems that his or her future will be determined somehow. Is planning carefully while you are still young the best way to ensure a good future for yourself? In my point of view, I have three reasons why I do not agree with this statement. Firstly, there is no "best" way for everyone to plan the future. Second, it is not possible for a person to decide his or her own future at the early age. Finally, life is always full of unexpected adventures for everyone to overcome.

The first reason I have is that everyone cannot find the best way to plan the future. Since all human beings are absolutely different from the others, they may hold diversified ideas and decisions while facing the hardships in their lives. As time goes by, we have grown up and may realize that there is no solution that can fit everyone. From time to time we may choose to the way we like; however, we still have other alternatives to try. When it comes to planning the future, there may be a great number of explanations of the best way.

Moreover, while a person is still young, he or she cannot decide the way of his or her own future. Since almost everyone is brought up in the family, parents hold the right and direction of the life for their children. We all need some advice and suggestions from our elders and parents, but these plans may not the ones we want to choose. 

Last but not least, life is always filled with a variety of incident adventures for us to face. Once in a while unexpected things happen accidentally and that could change a person's whole life. We may need to confront those unknown challenges so that we can have a better understanding of our future. If life is arranged carefully already, what happiness can you find?
