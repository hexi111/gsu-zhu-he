Nowadays, there is a tendency that people emphasize the personal appearance and fashion. There are some opion that it is too much emphasis. On the other hand, others view this trend positively. I would say I am in the latter case. In other words, I disagree with the given statement above. There are several reasons why I support people's focusing on personal appearance and fashion.

First, emphasis on "looks" is a general trend in all parts of society. As the human society becomes modernized and the technology develops, the visuality is emphasized broadly not only regarding the personal appearance but also the design of buildings and all the products, for example the electronic items. Therefore, criticizing only the personal appearance and fashion is groundless. 

Second, it is natural for human beings to pursue visual beauty of oneself, especially when the more crucial and survival-related needs are fulfilled. The economic development, which has been spurred rapidly since the 19th century, met the low-level of human needs in many parts of the world. Therefore, we can see this pro-fashion tendency, which is very natural.

Thirdly, if improving the personal appearance and fashion provides the individual more confidence when communicating with other people and this gives positive outcome, this is something certainly worth to acquire. 

In this essay, several reasons why I do not agree on the given statement that nowadays people put "too much" emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. My arguement was that, in brief, this is not a phenomenon only for the individual level but also a very general one throughout the all the design sections of society. Also, this is very natural sequence of meeting human-desire from low to high level. Lastly, the positive effect of this tendency undermines the criticism on it.
