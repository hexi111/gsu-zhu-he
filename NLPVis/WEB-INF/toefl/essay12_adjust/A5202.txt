I strongly disagree with this statement. This statement is the issue in today's society. For instance, there are two people at the job interview with about the same level of studies. However, one person is considered to be a better looking than other one. Most people can easily know the answer of who is going to be employed. There are some people believe having employees with a good looking make a better environment in the office or a pride of the company. They just don't realize job seekers with a capability are not getting the job they deserved to have. On the other hand, having a good looking as  an advantage of themselves are getting a job so luckily. The personal appearance and fashion are leading today's society to be unfair. There must be some people who can stand up until the end to fight for the justice.
