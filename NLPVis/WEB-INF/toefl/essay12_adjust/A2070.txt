I agree that nowadays people put emphasis on their personal appearance and fashion. But with regard to the term "too much", I don't quite agree. 

First I think the pursuit of beauty has lasted throughout our human history, and it is our nature to make ourselves look better.  Therefore, I think it's not wrong to put an emphasis on the personal looking, as long as we can assure that all the other stuffs in our life are going pretty well.  Also, the love of fashion is also permitted by our better-off living condition. In the current world we can survive and live a luxurious life much more easily than our ancestors, which gives us the time to pay special attention to our exterior appearance.

Of course,  when fashion goes to a wrong direction and people just follow it blindly, this will cause a negative effect to our society. For an example, I observed that most Americans wear jeans, this is no problem, as jeans can bring a relaxed mind and a casual atmosphere so that we won't be so stressed. However, nowadays a trend is to wear tattered jeans, with a large hole on the knee, or smaller holes all over. I don't see any need or beauty in wearing clothes like this, although this trend has influence the young people in China as well. Therefore, the point I want to point out here is that fashion could go wrong, there is no need to pursue it all the way down.

Admittedly, another part of human nature is to dress similar to their peers, we don't want to be an outdated person. However, we must be aware that diversity brings out the beauty. So it is enough to pursue an exterior beauty in harmony with our mind, our tradition, and our inner beauty. To follow others blindly may not make us look better. 

Overall speaking, we should pay attention to our appearance and fashion, to give others a nice expression, and make the world a more beautiful place to live. A little reminder here is: have our judgement criteria, don't be led blindly by the worldly fashion.
