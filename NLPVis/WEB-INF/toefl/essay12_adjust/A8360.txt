The importance of appearance and fashion might not appear to some people, while it is  the very important to others. I am part of the second group. I do not think that people put too much emphasis on appearance nowadays. It has been the case for centuries. People have always wanted to follow fashion. 

In my opinion, fashion is an intersting way to express oneself. Your clothes are not only some things you put on your back to protect yoursefl from the cold or the sun. To me, clothes are a wonderful thing that shows who I am to people. In a lot of occasions, your outfit broadcasts a message that the society you are living in can understand: the mourning black, white symbol of purity usually wears in marriages. People want to be part of social groups, tribes. This is why they wear distinctive symbols such as clothes to show which tribes they belong to. Some people think that today we are the slaves of our own appearance. It is not true. What we wear is linked to what we want to look like. some people think they have to obey to fashion, I personnaly think that fashion has to obey me. If someone wants to wear something, I think that he or she should just wear it and stopping wondering about what people are going to think about it. 

For centuries people have been interested in the way they look. No one can deny that it is an important matter in our society. Of course, excess is never good. As long as your appearance does not become an obession, I think it is perfectly normal to take good care of your appearance.
