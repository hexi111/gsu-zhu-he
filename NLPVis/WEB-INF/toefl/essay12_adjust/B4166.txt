Any important event is planned well in advance, prioritizing events, budgeting for expenses and rechecking the arrangements to ensure its success .

So why should it be different for the biggest  and most important event,our life? 


Every one dreams of a good future for himself but when does he start planning for it? It is rare to see a person plan for the future until he is past his youth and matured ,having faced some harsh realities of life.

It is usually at this stage with the burdens of family life that a person starts to plan for his future.At this time he cannot plan for the years past ,education,marriage or occupation.

A young person who starts planning early is capable of orienting his energies in the direction he aims at and is capable of working towards a desired career through the proper education.

Thus proper planing at a young age affords him a great career and a positionin the society which has a telling effect on both his financial status and marital life.

A young person at the peak of his energies and plenty of time to plan for does not need to reorient himself or switch careers at a later time.


Thus planning at an early ensure a good future.
