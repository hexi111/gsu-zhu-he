Who’s the cover girl of Vogue or Cosmopolitan this month? What’s David Beckham and Victoria wear yesterday when they show on a fashion party? These questions are the most popular topics among the whole society today. Because out looking became more and more important in people’s life they are forced to distract lots of  energy on these in-things. 

Why this kind of phenomena come out? Why people nowadays pay too much attentions on personal appearance? I think this thought is not formed in one day. For a job hunter, the most important thing is his/her ability of course, but how can you win out among so many talented man? Good looking guys definitely take the advantages of their appearance. Employers today tend to choose a good looking man other than a mediocre man even if the latter one may more competitive for this job. They think these employees may give their costumes a good impression at the first sight. No wonder more and more people became to pay attention to the fashion things and want to dress themselves up like a movie star.

The other important reason is that people in this new age became to aware of their life quality, they think chase to luxury things is a healthful way to make themselves live a better life. Also, this kind of better life can make them more confident in doing other works in ordinary lives.
