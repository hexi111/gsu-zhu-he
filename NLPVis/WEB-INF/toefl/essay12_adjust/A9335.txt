Nobody can deny that personal appearance is important. Part of the parcel of personal appearance are suitable clothes, neat wardrobe, good shoes, and grooming. However I do believe that people put too much emphasis on both personal appearance and fashion. 

Your first impression of the day is likely to be based on your appearance. If you come to work wearing a tattered dress, people may sneer and not take you seriously. First impressions are the ones that stick most, and unfortunately, most people are judgmental. Therefore there is a very good reason for people to try to look their best at every possible opportunity.

Society today however tends to emphasize fashion just a little bit too much. People follow trends, haircuts, types of dresses which are mostly lead by celebrities. People also buy branded name products, Nike, GAP, Banana Republic, and many others, because of the social status that those product bring to the person wearing the clothes. 

Is it so important to wear the latest thing, or have the most sought after or most expensive clothing? I believe that as long as a person is neat and does not look out of place the person will make a good impression. Why should there be a need for expensive fashion that one must buy. Will a person look significantly better in a $1600 suit compared to a $160 one? Probably not.

The objective of personal appearance should be on neat, tidy, and maybe even color coordinated and not on high priced fashion. 

Another aspect of personal appearance and fashion is of course the issue of self confidence and projecting ourselves. it is disturbing that our focus on fashion has led us to stop focusing on other things such as our attitudes towards other, how hard we work, and our success. We need to change our focus from our clothes to our attitudes and personality. Attitudes and personality are more important to a person's growth than any clothes
