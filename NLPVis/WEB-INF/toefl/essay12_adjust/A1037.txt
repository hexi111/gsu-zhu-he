It is absolutely true in reality that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. According to the reports from news, some people, especially some young women might be crazy about appearance and fashion.  

Everyday when you turn on TV, you have to watch so many boring commercial advertisements about cosmestics, fashion, surgery on face and body, and healthy nutritious drug. Usually, E channel or MTV channel have so many TV programmes to teach people how to be fashionable. Media portrayal of people's appearance influence the general public. 

Nowadays people gradually develop some routine criteria to judge the people around them through appearance and fashion.  Who is beautiful or handsome? thin, not fat; tall, not short; big breast, not A cup; young, not old and having wrinkle; sexy, not plain. 

The trend of putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion are not good and healthy. First it results in anti-aging or ageism. It is unfair to the vulnerable older people. Moreover, fashion sometimes is equal to luxury. It wastes people lots of money and time. Third, the criteria ignore, even destroy the diversity of characters. people seldom spend time to understand their characteristic  of their friends. 

Personal appearance and fashion should not be the most important things in our lives, because more meaningful and valuable things should be carried over in practice.
