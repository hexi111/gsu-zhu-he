Nowadays, people in the developed country are over-emphasized on their personal apperance and fashion. I would like to disset the underlying reasons.

First, people are easy to get any information under the advanced society. When people surf the internet, they must explose to the advertisements which are mostly in fashion industry. Under the advertisement effect, they will find that they are lagging behind the trendy world. Therefore, they are willing to spend a lot of money and time to pursue every trend. Moreover, when they see their favourite idol, they will pursue what they have.

Second, people mostly get around with friends. They will exchange the most updated information such as what trend will be in this year, which brand is most popular and etc. Under the peer effect, they will follow the updated trend in order to consolidate their friendship. Sometimes, they will think that they can not keep a close friendship without the common topic. They even think they are not competitive if they wear the out-dated fashion. 

Third, people will adjust one's ability in the first impression through their appearance. In the job interview, the interviewr will have the first adjustment to you through your appearance. When the other candidate has more or less the same qualification with you, the interviewr will choose the one who has better appearance.  Even in the meeting a new friend, they will adjust you to see whether you can be a friend or not.

I think people should not put much emphasis on their appearance and fashion. It is not healthy to them because it wastes a lot of time and money.
