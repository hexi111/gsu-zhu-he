I personally disagree with this statement to some extent. I know that careful planning in your youth can help you ensure a good future but there is an extent to which this is true. The world is too full of uncertainties for this to hold true. Some of the few things which can make a carefully planned future go bad include: bad investments, natural disasters, death, divorce  and ill health.

Nobody goes out hunting for a bad future but certain mishaps cannot be avoided. I have heard of so many people make great investments in the stock markets, real estate and other financial markets and have lost everything. A most recent example is the Enron case where peoples total life savings were lost. These people had planned for a good future but never could have predicted this is how it would end.

Natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and volcanoes have been seen to wipe away the hard sweat of people. In the hurricane Katrina, people lost all they had carefully planned for in their youth. In the recent wild fires in California peoples million dollar homes and property were burnt to the ground.

Death and bitter divorces also can rob people of all that they have carefully planned for. Death of a parent or spouse can cause peoples lives to come to a halt.

Ill health is as unpredictable as the weather in Michigan, people have had their hopes of a good future shattered by terminal diseases like  Alzheimer's, cancer just to name a few.

Some of these things can never be predicted. Its good to plan for the future in your youth but there is no guarantee that the future is going to be good based on the plans you have put in to place.

We can do what is in our power when ever possible to secure  ourselves a good future but there are so many external factors which may go against us. I am not totally against planning for the future but I don't think  it holds any guarantees.
