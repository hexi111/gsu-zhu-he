I somewhat agree with this statement. But before I go on, let us give a more concrete definition to the phrase "good future" as this is subject to various interpretations. My understanding of "good future" is one in which a person is financially capable of supporting himself or herself in society, and if necessary, his or her family as well. Now that the phrase "good future" is not as vague, let us look at the importance of planning carefully the moment one becomes capable of looking forward to the future. 

In the United States and more advanced countries, great emphasis is placed on college graduation and degree. In other words, a college degree is a necessity if one has dreams of pursuing a high paying job and in extension, have a good future. Obtaining a degree on time if at all means careful planning all through high school and well into college.

A person needs to have a good game plan in order to graduate high school with the required amount of credits. In most cases, one must not only graduate high school in the usual allotted time frame of four years, but one must also maintain good grades. Then there is the need to keep careful watch over scholarships and deadlines for potential colleges.

Once again, even after being admitted to colleges, a person needs to know what direction he or she wants to take in order to take the classes necessary to fulfill the credits for majors and qualify for graduation. 

Any mis step along the way might very well delay or worse, foil the attainment of a degree and in consequence, a good future.
