I agree with the statement that I  need to plan my future very carefully and set up a clear goal of their life. 

Good begining, good ending. For all the young, their life look a white paper, and it needs themfelves to draw. When people do a research and the most important thing is the guide, which is kind of like the plan for the young, and the guide can help the researchers to avoid the mistakes and avoidable trouble. That's also the same reason that the young need the plan for their future, and they need to plan very step for their success. in my plan, I know what I should everyday and do the things right, and do the right thing. so I need to plan my future.

Planing carefully can help people to find their mistakes
not only for the young but also for all the people, especially for the young. All the people want to have a wonderful future, but it is not ensured in a short time. when they meet trouble in reality, they need to stop and think about themslves and the skills or strateges. The successful have a ability that they can find the useful thing from thier lose. the plan gave them the trace which described their life. without the plan, when people memorized thier passed life, it was a piece of white paper.

Conclusion, it is usegl and helpful for me to plan my futuer. Looking bcak my life and experience, and study, it gave me direction of hard working.the young need to plan their life. it is for them to set up the goal of the life, in other word, it is a woderful future.
