Everyone wants a good career, some plan the future earlier and some are not. I think to make sure we have a good future is to plan ahead. There are several reasons for this.

Firstly, it is said, 'Earlier is always than later.' which is true for a lot of things. For a good future ,definitely it is true. If you plan ahead,you can make up your mind earlier and prepare well. When the time is right,you are well equipped,ready to go without hasty.

Secondly,When you are young,you make some plans,later if you want to change,you always have time to change it. But if you do this later in your life ,say when you are old,it is not very possible for you to make big changes. It is bad to regret over your decision and not able to change it for lack of time.

Thirdly,good future and career take time and tries. Without enough time to think about it ,perhaps you will fail later. And without several tries ,maybe you won't get the ideal plan. So you need time to prepare and practice you plan earlier,why not do it now,earlier? 

Anyway,from my point of view,I do think  The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. No matter from experience or lesson I learned,I really think if you plan very carefully when you are young,you have more chances to win .
