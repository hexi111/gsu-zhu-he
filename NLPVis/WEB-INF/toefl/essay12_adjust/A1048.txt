In the society today, most people value their appearance even more than their own personality. Since many individuals think making a good impression is the most important aspect for a person, they tend to forget about their own characteristics. Therefore, I strongly agree that people place too much time and effort on their physical appearance for following reasons: they want to avoid some ostacles and the result of peer pressure.

Some people want to use their "outside" to attract others around them for an easy way out in certain jobs. Usually females always feel insecure about their outer image. They will do anything to obtain the maximum level of beauty. As a result, they will use their beauty to help them obtain any position they want. In contrast, they may use it to avoid some works they do not want to do.

Another reason is the peer pressure surrounding everyone to look "good" or "better" than another. Today, there are ton of stores selling different styles of clothes which change every now and then. As the style changes, people will discard their old clothes and chase after the new ones to look cool like everyone around them.

In conclusion, no matter what age group, nationality, or background, most people believe personal appearance is very essential. They think it it important to keep up with the fashion trend. In my opinion, I think appearance and personality have equivalent worth to each other.
