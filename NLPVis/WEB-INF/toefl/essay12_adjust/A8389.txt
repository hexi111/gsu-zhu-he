With the advent of 21st century, the increasing people put their attention on personal appearance and fashion. And more and more fashion weeks appear in a lot of countries. Personally, I don't think it is a good action to spending too much times on appearance and fashion.

Firstly, the most suitable clothes can present your situtation in the society. It is hard to imagine that a cleaner weared a fashion when she was working. It is also cannot be possible that a techer put too much comestic on her face. 

Secondly, it is not a good trend for the adolescent's developing. If the students spend too much of their studying times on fashion, they would forget their responsibilities. Meanwhile, they would ask their parents for more money on appearance.

Last but not least, it would become families' burden if all of the families' members spend too much of their income on apperance and fashion. It is not a wise choice to persuiting the fashion too much. It is good to have one or two fashion clothes when the important party or meeting will come.

We can't not deny that the fashion and good apperance make the world colorful. However, the important thing for each one is the most suitable clothes and appearance is the best fashion for you.
