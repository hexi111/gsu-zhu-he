I agree with the statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion.  Although it is people's choice to pursue how much they care about their own apperance and fastion, i still believe that there are too many people who only care about how to achieve them and do not care about polishing other things. 

First of all, many women really care how they look and what they wear. Although women, in general, tend to like caring about their apperence and fasion any periods of time, at present quite a few women are crazy about paying too much attention for them by spending tons of time and money. While many current women and they try to lose weight all the time in order to look good. For example, many teenagers in South Korea spend much money for clothes and they try to improve how they look through pocessing expensive clothes and accessaries while many Japanese girls are crazy about doing on a biet even thouh they are already skenny.

Second, Nowaday, not only female but also guys really care about their appearence and fashion. In my country Japan, many Japanese men buys a lot of fashionable clothes more and care about how they look, compared with 20 years ago. For example plastic surgery is getting popular among young Japanese male, while the sale of men's cosmetic brands are increasing recently.  

In sum, there is a tendency that people in general are paying too much attentions for how they look and what they wear. It would be preferable if they also put emphasis on their inner beauty.
