I agree with the above statement. And following are the reasons behiend it.

Firstly, Among people especially young generation, the craze about personal appearance is very high. Previously people used to wear clothes just to hide their body, but now it is not the case. I am not saying that wear shabby things, I am just saying not to be over fationable.

Sometimes to look good, people go to such an extent that they change their entire appearance. You must always respect the god's gift. God has made everyone beautiful.

We should understand what is beauty first. It's not the outside look which matters, but you should look beautifull to yourself. You have to be fationable for your happiness but not for others happyness.

Beign fationable does not mean wearing wiered clothes with make others feel uncomfortable or abuse others.
Even the media is supporting this. Day by day fation designers are coming up with new designs which are no where related to fation.

Because of this fashion, middle class families are facing lot of problems. For example children of middle class families are influenced by their other classmates who might be from high class society and the middle class children might not be able to get such fashnable clothes.
This can create infeority complex among them and can lead to depression as well.

To conclude I say that fashion to a limit, is always acceptable. But nowadays it has exceeded the limit and I suggest that some serious decisions have to be made in this regard.
