I agree that physical appearances are very important today, more than a fashion. But this depends a lot of the country and the city you are leaving.

As example is very different the perception of fashion in East Lansing, a students city, than in New York the capital of business and fashion. If we compare two countries the US is more informal than countries like Italy and Japan where the people really expend a lot of money in fashion cloths.

On the other hand physical appearances are taking in account in all cities and countries, where your weight, shape and size are judged. Even though the cultures are different and have different values.

I can tell you that I am Mexican and I am fat and big for the Mexican standards, in the US I fell pretty comfortable because I can find my cloth size and I am considered just big. But when I went to Japan I was huge, I was afraid to fit in the buses and public transportation. I did not find any blouse that fit me, not even in the man section, which was horrible.

Even though there are new laws for the top models to change the cultures and the customs of the countries is almost impossible. Because the body shape it is a perception of value where persons are judge  by physical appearance. 

With respect to fashion I have learn that the best fashion is what it helps my body to look well and I try to stay in a very conservative fashion incorporating some accessories or the fashion colors to my wear drove.  "from the fashion what fits you", it is a phrase we use a lot in Mexico and I think is very wise.
