Every one wants a perfect future.A hefty bank balance, nice home , Porche or Bentley car and someone to enjoy all these things with. Often it is considerd that, the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young, but i disagree.

To start with, i am from  India, where human population is exploding. To ensure a good life for a middle class person, the only pathway is education and hardwork. Parents  put their kids from childhood in extracurricular activities and try to make them multi talented. If the kids dont excel they will be lost in the competetion. So its always emphasized, that plan what you want to be, when you are still young. 

On the other hand , when i came to United states, students seemed here more relaxed. First two years in college they are made to study everything and they dont know till the end of two years what they want to be. If you ask a sophomore what you want to major in, they will say " not decided yet". Here students take thier own time to figure out what career they want to pursue. In india you dont get that much time. 

so the statement that plan your future while still young differs from place to place.

Also in life sometime things happen which are not in your control and planning fails, although this may apply to small percent of people.

But I think if one wants to explore and understand life in full, one needs time and experience. so i think there should be some flexibility and priorities need to be changed. If that is done i think still there will be a good future, eventhough one has not planned life from earlier.
