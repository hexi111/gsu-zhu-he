Making a good plan ahead is beneficial in many ways in lives. It will reduce a possibility of making a mistake and help organize things effectively. I agree with the claim that careful plannning at a young age will be the best to ensure your bright future.

Planning at an early age will enable you to save your time and money. Some people spend their childhood without being aware of what they would like to do when they grow up. Once they become adults, they follow what other people advise them to do, which could end up with disliking what they are doing. For example, a friend of mine, soojin went to law school because her father was a lawyer and he had always wanted her to follow his path. After she spent years of law school, paying a high tuitirion, took a bar exam, and did legal practices, she discovered that it was not what she wanted to do during her life. Later when she turned age 35, she realized that what she wanted to be was a kindergarten teacher and she changed her career. If she had planned her future carefully earlier, she would have saved her time, money, and efforts.

Next, early planning will help develop independence skills. When children are asked to plan their future early in their lives, it is they who are able to plan, control, and guide their future. In other words, they learn how to be responsible for their own lives. My parents taught me how to stand alone since I was little. My life has been planned and driven by myself since I was at age 8. It was I who decided to study in the United States and become a professor in the field of language education. Now I am proud of the fact that I could manage to do so on my own.

Plannning a future early in life will bring many advantages. It will make your life more effective, which will reduce your time, money, and energy. In addition, it will facilitate the growth of self-independence. I truly believe that careful planning at an early age will be the best way to bring your promising future.
