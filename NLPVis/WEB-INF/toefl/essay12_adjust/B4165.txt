I agree that one needs to plan carefully when still young, to ensure good future. One of the best things about the future is that its full of surprises and the unexpected things can happen, which sometimes, be very unsecure if we are not prepared for it. One of the important things in this world is money. There are lot of people who spend all their earnings and don't care about tomorrow. Tomorrow is something that we don't know whats in it for us. For example we may be hospitalised, and if we don't have savings for those pursopses, we would be in a chain of debts, which inturn causes frustration. There fore it is always good to have plan for our future.
