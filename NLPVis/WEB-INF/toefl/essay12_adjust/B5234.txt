I disagree.

There's a famous article named 'Youth'. Youth doesn't mean red lips, young face, youth means the young heart. There are many famous people making their career decision when they are not young. The only area full of gifted young people I know is music. Mozart, Schbert, Chopin, etc. were well-known before they were ten years old. But generally speaking, many great people made their decisions later. Because when you are fairly old, you have broader eyesignt than young people, you know what you like, you know what you really want to devote yourself in. 

In China, there's a famous Special Class for the Gifted Young. They are university students 4 years younger than general university students. It turns out that people in this class don't know what they like. How can they plan their future. 

I don't mean that you don't need to plan carefully when you are still young. But the most important thing should be keep a young and active heart.
