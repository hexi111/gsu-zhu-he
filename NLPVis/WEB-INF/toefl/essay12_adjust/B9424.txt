In China, there is an old saying about planning for a good future. If translated into English, it is: People can see what you will do in the future from your childhood. This is reasonable. We can see from this saying that the best way to ensure a good future for onself is to plan carefully while he or she is still young. 

The golden time of people's life is when you are still young. If young, you are full with imagination and passion. You have plenty of time and chances. You are fresh to everything. If you have a mistake, others will forgive you. So it is the best time to learn, to work and to plan for your future. My parents often complain about their life. They say they are tired to the same work day by day. They say they are easy to get illed and feel uncomfortable about their body. They say they often feel they have no time to do everything well. They say: " If we were as young as you, that is amazing!" They often told me, the best time of life is the young time. You must plan for your whole life, or you will feel regretted in the future. I think they are right. When people get older, they are tired about the daylife. They have less passion to do thing well. 

It is also the best time to ensure a good future when you are still young. After learning for a long time in school, one is clear about what he or she wants to do in the future. People learn a lot from childhood. When he enters a college, he meets different majors, jobs and friends. He will know what he wants and what is the most suitable for him. If failes, he still has enough chances to correct it. So it is the good time to make a plan of one's future. 

To sum up, I agree with the opinion that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.
