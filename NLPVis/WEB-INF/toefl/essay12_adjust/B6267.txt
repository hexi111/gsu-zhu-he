"Plan can never catch up with changes." I cannot agree with the argument that people should make everything certain when they are in their teenagers. 

It is always not bad to propose a schedule whenever before we start. We can make some adjustment to our strategies according to our rough estimation about the near future. Sometimes thinking carefully before starting really prevent some trouble that may appear.

But thinking of a plan for our whole life? Maybe it is possible for us to work out a short schedule list for a near future. But it seems nobody can predict what the world will be like ten years later. The world is full of uncertainty which actually prevent us from knowing issues about tomorrow.

Someone may argue that with the advance of technology, there still exist probability that we can deduce what our future will look like from the current knowledge we have. If that becomes true, life would be tedious, especially for the young. Most seniors regards the children and teenagers as "lucky ones", for their life are imbued with prospectus and hope. If we can make a detailed plan for every young man, the young would have to move in their fixed orbits as they supposed to. That means they will never have chance to choose their lives freely. Because everything is set precisely and rigidly for them.

The most valued characteristic of the young is their creative mind. The world will not evolve without the discoverary and invention of the young. Why should we still try to put constraints that should not belong to the young on them?

Let the young fly.
