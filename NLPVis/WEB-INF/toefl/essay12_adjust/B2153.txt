Future, for the children, is the dream. Every child has the dreams, becoming a scientist like Steven Hawking, a famous sport star like Michael Jordan even a computer genius like Bill Gates and so on. So to achieve the dream, everyone must have a good plan for the future.

The first reason is " Plan is the way to  the success". If the future is the top of the mountain,the plan is the step of the way. Only increase what you are doing in everyday, you can achieve your dream. 

secondly, the plan can help you join a life everyday. I think maybe everyone has this experience: they do not know what he should do now. Doing this thing is good, and doing that thing is also not bad. Everything he wants to do, but finally he does nothing. This fact shows if a person do not have a clear and useful plan, everyday for him is bad. And also it shows how important of making a plan.

So, for one word, I think plan for the future is very important. If you make a good plan and follow the plan, I think you will have a success finally.
