I think we have to ready and make plan for our future when we are young. If we are young, we could plan and make effore for what we want then even if the plan is wrong we can change that easily, so we can reach our life's goal easily.  

Plnning our life is important. When we are young we have a lot of chaces to try something, so we can find our abilitise.

For example, we learned various kind of knowlege when we were children. We can learn many things easily and fine what you really want to study. However, we study about narrow and deep major when we enter the university. If you enter the university, it is not easy to change your major like quitting 
to learn piano or painting when you were young. I think you should find your own character and abillities when you can get many experience.

Next, if you are young, it would be effective to do work than old people eventhough doing same work. Moreover, if you are young,  you can change your study or career easily.
Sometimes we find our major or career is not interesting. However, changing these needs a lot of cost like time and money. If you plan your life when you are young, you can save these time and money, and use that other valuable area like develop your career and enjoying life with your family having lots of leisure time. 

I believe that living our life is like doing marathon. It is not short-timed running. We would have many chances, fortunes,
or serious bed time. Although our start is late, We can overcome that with efforts and live happily. What I want to say is you can go ahead and prepare to your life when you are young by planning your life carefully. This is because it need more efforts and costs to planning it if it is late.
