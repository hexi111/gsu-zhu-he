With the developing of the socielty, people put more emphsis on the personal apperance and fashion. Like what the others wearing, what they eat and how much moeny they earned every month.

On my personal opinion, I do not think this is a good situation. First, what the others did it does not matter to you. What the most important to you is do you best. Second, sometimes you can not compare with the others. Because, each people has limited ability. Which is the world so colorful. Third, there is on end to catch the fashion. There come out a lot new things every day and you can not get what you want all the time. Once you owned some thing you will need another better things. So I think what is more important is satisfly. Satisfly what you have and what you get.

On the other hand, put too much time on personal appearance and fashion is kind of wast time and money. We all that when to put to much time on something, you must put fewer time on the other. So when people put to much time on the appearance, they must put fewer time on working and studying.

In one word, put attention on personal appearance is understanderale, but do not put to much attention. Otherwise, you will lose some more important things.
