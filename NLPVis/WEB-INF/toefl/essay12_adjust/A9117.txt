In the 20th century, most of people concentrated on their personal appearance and fashion very much. I would like to dissect the reasons behind. 

First of all, when people have a job interview, they will dress up properly, and even care about their personal appearance such as tidy up their hair, little make-up, and clean up their clothes and shoes. They want to give a good first impression to the employer. Moreover, most of the employers will not only hire the potential people, but also the good-looking people, especially in some service industry.

Second, when people have dating, they will also care their personal appearance and fashion. They desire to show their best to their friends or even their partners. Some people may have beautiful dress up in order to gaining other's attention. Sometimes, they don't care about the comfort of the clothes, they just care about the other's eyesight. 

Besides, during the high competitive society, most of people are influenced by their peers, friends, colleages and advertisement. They think they are loser if they don't have beautiful clothes or brand name products. They always compare with others. They ignore their purchasing power, just follow the trends blindly. 

Personally, I will not put too much emphasize on my personal appearance except in some necessary occasion. I will care about the comfort first. It is not healthy to dress up with some irrational reasons such as gaining other's attention,  comparing others and even following the trends blindly. We should emphasize on the needs of the occasion.
