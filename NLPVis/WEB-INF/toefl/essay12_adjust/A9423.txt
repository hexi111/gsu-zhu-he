Some people argue that nowdays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I agree with this argument. It is good to emphasize on personal appearance and fashion, but caring too much about them would be a waiste of time and distract people from other more important things. In addition, it is easy to over spend money if people care too much about fashion

First, putting too much emphasis on personal apprearance and fashion will distract people from doing other more important things. There is fashion show on TV all day long, and there are all kinds of information showing how to improve personal appearance. If people watch this kind of show and accept too much about fashion, they are easy addicted to the fashion itself. They would think that fashion is the most important and spend most of their time studying fashion. As a result, they can not do their regular work well. They might not have enough time to share with their family members and friends. Therefore, caring too much on fahshion will prevent people from doing something more important.

Second, it is easy to spend money out of budget if people care too much about personal appearance and fashion. There are so many kinds of makeups in the department stores. Some of them are very expensive. With the advertisement on TV, people will buy some unnecessary makeups or buy something beyond their budget. Actually, they could have spent money working out in the gym to make them look more vigorous and attractive. 

In conclusion, I do not recomment people to emphasize too much on persoanl appearance and fashion. People have many alternatives to make themselves more vigrous and attractive. They can work out in the gym, read books.
