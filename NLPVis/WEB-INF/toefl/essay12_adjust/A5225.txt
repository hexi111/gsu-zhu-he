I would say appearance is one of the most important factors in every way and I disagree with the quote given above "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion".

For most people, when you meet a new person, the first thing you would look at or think about is the person's appearance not only because it is the only thing you can see but also because it tells you a lot about the person. Appearance is not just about how good-looking the person is or how slim she is or whatever. It is also about if the person has a nice smile on the face or what kind of expression she/he makes while you are talking with her/him and how she/he takes care of how she/he looks on the outside.

Since appearance is a crucial factor in people judging you especially for the first time meet, I would say people put just about enough emphasis on personal appearace and fashion nowadays.
