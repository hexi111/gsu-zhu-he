I am living in Los Angeles, a city of fashion. The first day I arrived here, I noticed that people in this city tend to look very stylish. Actually, nowadays people pay more and more attention to personal appearance and fashion. I think it is necessary to put emphasis on personal appearance.

There are more choices for customers in the clothing market now. In a modern society, there is more and more competition within the clothing business. In order to survive, they have to provide artistic and unique designs and try to lead the fashion. As a result, customers find more and more cute and decent clothes in the shop windows. There is no reason that a girl does not buy a breathtaking dress at a reasonable price.

Fashion design comes from art and everyone has the right to enjoy the beauty of art. Thanks to those designers, art comes out of museums and royal palaces, and goes into daily life of ordinary people like us. I cannot see any reason that one should reject this gift.

The appearance of a city is represented by the appearance of citizens. I like walking along westwood village, because  people walking by all look neat and stylish. When we go to a city, we would like to see a city with fashion and stylish people. It would be weird to see people walking in a modern city dressed like being from Civil War time.

In a word, it is true that people pay more and more attention to personal appearance and fashion. I personally vote for it and I am more than happy to see a world with beauty, art and fashion.
