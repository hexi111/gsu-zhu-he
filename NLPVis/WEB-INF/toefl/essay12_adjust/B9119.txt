"The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young."

I strongly agree with the above statement.

It is extremely important to plan your life strategically, especially when it comes to such areas as school, career, and family.

First of all, a person has to learn how to be responsible. The most important players in that are parents and teachers.

One area where careful planning for a future is important is a retirement. That is where the above saying applies fully. You have to start saving money while you are still young, and the younger you start, the less you will have to contribute on regular basis.  Saving for your own future retirement will ensure a good future and stability.

Another area where careful planning for a future is important is a family planning. One have to be careful when chooses his or her partner who they decide to marry. They have to consider all pros and cons. They have to plan their life very carefully, and also, the couple has to mutually agree when to have children and how many. 

At last, school is a best way to learn how to make things that you want to happen in your life -- happen.  That is where planning and ability to work hard are very important. If you want a good grade, you have to work hard, you have to learn how to manage your time and how to set your priorities. At the end, you will most likely get the results equivalent to how much time and effort you put in.

At last, I have to say that discipline is the quality that is crucial to have if you want to achieve your goals. Discipline is something that you can train in yourself. It is not a gift of nature, and it is something that anybody can attain. It is that simple. At the same time, it is not easy, as it requires one to have a will power, strong character, and ability and willingness to work hard.
