Whether or not people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fasion depends on the country and, of course individuals. I have been living in foreign country for six months, and I have known people in two countries, Japan and the U.S. As I already stated I think how much people emphasis on the fasion depends on the society and individuals, however, I can fairly say "yes" to this question. People do care about their appearance no matter where they live, however the degree how much they care is somewhat different. People tend to care about appearance and fasion because,  unfortunatelly, people tend to treat you differently depending on your appearnace. However how much and how people emphasis on them depends on the counries. 

People tend to care about appearnce because they tend to be judged by appearance. It is different story after people get to know each other well, but it is true people judge people first by impression; and the  impression comes from appearance. Of course everybody want to give good impression, so there is a reasonable reason that people do care about their apperance.

However, in my opinion, how much and how people emphasis on appearance and fasion vary between societies. For example, compared to American youth, Japanese youth care about their fasion "too much." Although I did not notice when I was in Japan, Japanese boys and girls seem that they always wear the "best" cloths; people nevr walk with a T-shirt and  pants; it's "too plane." On the other hand, American boys and girls seems that they don't care the appearance on the first sight. Actually they do concern the appearance, but it depends on the occasion. they seems they don't care about fasionin day time, but they do look like caring in in night time; they never go to a club with a T-shirt and a plane pants.

All in all, I fairly can say people do care about the apearance but it depends on the society, and at the same time depends on the occasion.
