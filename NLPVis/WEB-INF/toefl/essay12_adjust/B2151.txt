I can't help agree with this topic any more.  We should prepare everything before when it comes, especially our future.

When I was a child, I didn't know everything much.  My parents arrange all my things, such as my primate school, my spare time, my flavor and also my hobby like that they sent me to a drawing training class.  As my growing, my parents also arrange all my things.  I transfer to an important middle school, so I have to leave my friends.  I study a music instrument during my high middle school.  All of my things are arranged by my parents.  They give me a comfortable atmosphere, although sometimes I feel I am useless to do anything by myself.

Now I go abroad to further study in USA and a lot of things I have to face just by myself.  I should plan everything by myself.  I must make sure that I will have a good future after I have two years' study in USA.  

Future: tomorrow is a future of today, today is the future of yesterday, the last minute is a future of the right minute and the last second is a future of the right second.  Future is right now.  We don't want to waste our life including everybody.  Plan carefully the right second, you will have a good future in the next second.
