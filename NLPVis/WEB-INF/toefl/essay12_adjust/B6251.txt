Every parents in Asia plan the future for their children carefully to ensure their success. Also, they ask their children to do so. However, it is not always good for them, especially when they are still young.

First, plan the future too early will constrain the development of children. When children are young, they should learn as much thing as possible and after they have some knowledge and experiences, they will find out something they are interested in and plan the future by themselves. When a child is too young, he has no ability to distinguish which path is better for him and even he choses one path, it will still change from time to time with his age grows up. So, it is definitely not good choice to let children plan their future when they are too young. 

Sometime, the parents will set up a goal for their childen when they are young. It is also not good enght. It is ture that these goals are good, such as being a professor or lawer. However, the biggest problem is the children do not like it at all. So, one commen phemonimon in Asian family is the parents force their children to learn something.  Some years later, the children might success, but they will have no good memory such experiences.

I think the best way is to encourage the children to try different things when they are young. They will enjoy the experience and sometime they will show the interest and potential on doing something. When the children grow older, they will set up the goals for their futures. 

As a conclusion, planning the children's future too early is not good for them. A better way is to encourage them to try and find out their own interests.
