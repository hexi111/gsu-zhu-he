As far as the above statement is concerned, I  quite agree that in our current society, people are judged by their personal apprearance and the dress they wear. That is the major reason why people put too much emphasis on personal apperearnce and fashion nowadays.

There are several hidden reasons why peeple are likely judge a person by their appearance and the dress they wear.
First, when you are a stranger for a person who is supposed to have more power than you. You are in a position of being judged by another. How can strangers get to know with each other? Of course, the first impression is very important. Personal appearance and the nice dress of course could convey a person's taste, somewhat reveals what kind of person you are. It is reasonable that a person's dress code and behaviors can convey some of your personal messages just like a person's language.

Second, someone's dress also could reveals a person's social status and economic condition. If your dress is not appropriate, you may be forbidden to ener some social circles.

Therefore, people pay more and more attention to their personal appearance and fashion in our society.

That's why we are advised that if you go for a job interview, you need to dress up and try your best to give your empolyer a good impression. A good start is half done. However, I also believe, one's outside part is important, but the most important is the inner part, which is the spiritual part of a person. If you need to gain a person's sustainable trust and long lasting friendship, a person's inner part ( such as integrity, character/personality, moral senses, etc.) is more important than the outside part (appearance/fashion).
