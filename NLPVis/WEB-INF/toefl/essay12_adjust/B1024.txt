I do support the view expressed in the statement quoted above. No doubt, it is a common wisdom to compare young age with the 'sowing season', and  the old age with the 'harvesting season'. So, it makes perfect sense for us to 'plan carefully' when we are still young, so that we can hope to 'harvest' 'good future' when we will be old. Now I will pose some more reasons in support of my stated position on the issue:

Young age is full of vitality and aspirations. But, this is also the time when people would like to have most fun. So, if in early days of our lives we can find out our dream professions that are aligned with our passions, then  we can best combine our energy and love to build up careers that will provide us not only financial security, but also joy and sense of fullfilment in our later days.

If we do not spend our youth productively, then, in we may be forced to struggle for our day to day subsistence when we are old. So, it is always advisable to work hard in the first part of the life, and, then relax at old age, never vice versa!

Plans should also include backup components or exit strategies, and should be tested earlier in one's life to check if they are working out as was originally expected. It is easier to change a career or learn new technologies when a person is young, than when he or she is much older. A youth spent unplanned may be faced with harsh reality in the later life where the only alternative survival strategy is to learn now trades and make 180 degree turns in  career paths. Such drammatic changes are easier to make when a person is young than when  he or she is gray haired.

Considering the reasons posed above, I reiterated my support to the statement mentioned above.
