Personal appereance and fashion have become the main things in people's lives nowadays. We can see that, everywhere we go, we can see many people are totally obssessed with fashion and their own appearance. Plus, some of them rather come up with some new hair styles, trendy clothes and many more. However, they sometimes do not really realize that they are really concerned with their own apperance untl they forgot about their own culture and values of life. Therefore, I totally agree with the statements that people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. There are many reason people tend to act like that.

First of all, people like to put too much emphasis on personal apperance because as we already realize and it is proven in psychology that, we, people, can easily attracted with the first apperance of others. We tend to like someone more to his or her apperance rather than their innerselves. A typical example can be seen from a new artist who we like. We tend to like an artist first because of his or her apperance, and then their talent. Consequently, people somehow realize that appearance gives a main attracttion to oneself. That's why they prefer to emphasis too much on their personal apperance and fashion.

Secondly, people will feel a new satisfaction whenever they come up with a new apperance. They will surely feel free with their new fashion or hair style maybe. Therefore, they prefer to change their apperance frequently from time to time so that they will feel the satisfaction that they want plus, they will not be called an old fashioned people.

In conclusion, people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion because people can easily be attracted by the first apperance and they can feel their satisfaction with their new look evertime they change it.
