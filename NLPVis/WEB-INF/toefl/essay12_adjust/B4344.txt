the statement states, "The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.". I completely agree with this for many reasons. The first reason is time. There is an Arabian adverb says "time is like a sword. If you didn't cut it, it cut you." in other words, time is very important mattter in this life. It's something that we can't make up. So, we have to use it the best way. Since life is based on time, and it starts from when we are young until we get older, we have to use this time, our life, the best ways we can. Therefore, we have to start planning from our young days to ensure the time consuming. 
Another reason for that is chances. Chances are something we can't predict
