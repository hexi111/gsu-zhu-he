Though there is povertry in the world, it is not denying that more and more people put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, or put much. Some one may think it ‘s the cost of money or wasting of time. However, in my opinion, it’s reasonable for people to pay an attention to their appearance and fashion. 

First of all, it’s the human instinct to love beauty. Even in the primary society, original human have known to wear on clothes which were made of leaves. One the other hand, the poor would like to take on their best clothes when they go out and visit by others. In this case, emphasis on appearance is not only an instinct, but also a type of policy.

And nowadays, with the development and improvement of society, people are becoming to have more and more money. After satisfying the basic requirement of the life, people begin to put much emphasis on the appearance and pursue fashion. Whereover and whenover, people will find the ads regarding the jerwelys. From the TV or movies, the stars will take more and more expensive diamonds and suits. By the effect of stars, ordinary people also begin to watch on fashion. More and more people join the Festival of Clothes, more and more people have on big brands.
To sum up, it is apparent that people put more and more emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. As for “too much” is concerned, I  do not think all people have this question, possibly a part of them..
