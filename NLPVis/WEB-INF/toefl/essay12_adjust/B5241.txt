I believe this could be true. I believe that without preparation, there cannot be a great chance for a successful future. In today's world, the competition is pretty intense in the job market. The more you are qualified and the more diplomas you have, the better the chance are for you to get a good job.

Yet planning when young is not always the best thing. When we are young, we make decisions that are going to influence the rest of our lives , like choosing our majors or choosing the person we want to mary. But because we are very young and have little experience on life in general, those choices are not always the best ones and we can come to regret them later.

I can take for example one of my father's friends, Guy. Guy and my dad have been friends since childhood and his dream has always been to become a doctor, a plastic surgeon. I went to med school, studied very hard, got his degree and started to exercise his profession. When Guy turned 36, he already amnaged to have his own practice and buisiness was going well...except that Guy did not like what he was doing, he was discussed by every single surgery he did and decided to to give up medecine...and decided to become a priest !!!
