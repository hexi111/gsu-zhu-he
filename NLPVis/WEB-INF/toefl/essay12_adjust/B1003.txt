Young is relative! Life can start or finish at any instant so there is no realistic way to ensure a future. therefore, I disagree with some people's obsession to plan everything in their lives. It might be reasonable to plan a weekend or next semesters' class schedules, but life in general is so uncertain that if you plan it then you don't live it. This is my emational attack against "planning carefully while still being young." Now, based on common sense, day-to-day life shows that drama is real, and it can give or take away anything in the less expected moment. There are circumstances that are out of our control and that for good or bad can change what we have, what we do, and what we are completely. For example, back in Venezuela almost 3 decades ago, my friend's dad was in prison when the worst earthquake that Venezuela has had took place. My friend's dad had killed someone in an assault--and although that still freaks me out--I have to recognize that I would have never imagined until my friend told me. He explained to me that living and surviving a 1 minute earthquake, seing so many people die, and being given a second chance to restart his life, make his dad change completely and work hard to get another life. I am pretty sure that my friend's dad never plan out going to jail and living an earthquake but he made the best out of the bad circumstances of life and turn these into opportunities to be whatever he could ever dream.  In my opinion, this is the only way we can at least enjoy the future we will have. We need to be receptive to changes of life and make the best out of all the circumstances and opportunities that we are given.
