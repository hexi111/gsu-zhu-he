Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. People that are not fashion or have a weird appearance are being discriminated by others. Personal appearance is very important for the communities because is a way to present yourself to the society. People that have a awful personal appearance are being discriminating by other. 

High school students tend to picked on other students that have a different fashion or personal appearance. Also, fashion industries influence the whole society with their propagandas and advertisements. Therefore, most of the people care how they look. People that are not fashionable are being biased by the public. As I mentioned earlier, some high school students are being picked on because they don’t give a good personal appearance. For example, most of the Asian students in the United States are being criticized by native. It is because they have different style of dressing.

Personal appearance is really important because it represent what kind of person you are. If you dress-up decently, people would think that you have money. In the contrary, if you dress-up sloppy then people would think that you are poor or a sloppy person.
