"The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young." When I was a kid, I had already heard it from my parents. I wasn't really understand its meaning and I didn't even think that it's important to me at that time. However as time goes by, I begin to believe that it's very important for young people to plan their future as soon as possible. When people has a target in their life they will know how to go for it otherwise they are wease their time. So it would be nice if people decide what their dream is and keep work it.
