When people are young, they are ambitious, and courageous. They can risk! Some young people accept life the way it is, and try to take everything it offers, but sometimes living the life as one day can lead to the not good consequences. 

Dreaming, planing, making goals is what young people should do. To ensure your good future and well-being, they have to plan carefully. For example, to be rich during the 30-40s requirement is to get a good education in college, find a good job, this is where money come from. 

While a person young, he should understand what he wants from life, what can he get from it to live it well. He should realize the purpose of his life, understand talents and abilities with what he was born to make his life meaningful for himself and people around him. 

When he realizes this, he starts to plan, so that he could express himself and be useful in society. If only everyone did that?
