That is obvious that I would agree with this statement. Strike iron while it's hot. When we are young we have a lot of time, ideas and thoughts that can help us to plan something for a future. There have to be a dream or the aim that you want to achieve in your life. To make that dream come true or to achieve the aim you need to use all of your physical and mental strength. When you are young you have huge amounts of these comparing to when you're old. If the aim of your life is hard to achieve and it is possible that it would take a big part of your life it would be better to start when you are young. When you're old and you need to start everything from scratch it wouldn't be possible for you to achieve your dream, but when you're old and at the same time you are half way to it, I think it is more than possible to get what you want - to achieve your dream. 

That's why most of us - students are here studying in university. We are young and have a lot of ideas, thoughts and desires that can help us to make our future better. It's only me who can make my future the way I want it to be. When we are studying we're getting information, knowledge, personal and life experience. All of these are very important in our life and especially in making our dreams come true. 

When I talk to different people I hear that some of them saying I want the time to go back, so that I would use the time that I had more efficient. That is fair enough to say that we unwisely waste our time everyday. We understand that we are wasting our time, but still we act the same way. One wise man said: We would always have enough time, if we used it properly. That is true. 

If we want to have a good future we need to use every minute of our life. Work hard when you're young and you'll get what you want when you'll be older - that is my opinion. While I'm still young I will follow it and in the future, I hope, my dream will come true.
