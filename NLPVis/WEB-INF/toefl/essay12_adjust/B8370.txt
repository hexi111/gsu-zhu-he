Ensuring a good future is not an easy duty to accomplish. Even when you think you did all the right work it might turn out that your future is still not good enough. I just believe that planning the future does not ensure you to have a succesful future. Although, the future is not completely predicable there are different things that we can do each day to make it better.

Accomplishing important things while we are still young can offer us a brighter future. Some of the matters that are significant to our present as doing well at school, chosing a reasonable and enjoyable degree, or keeping a good and strong reletationship with our family members or friends would help us to build a strong base for our future. If we choose to go to school and do well in it, it might first give us the opportunity to meet with educated people and secondly will increase our interests on getting a degree. Having good and intelectual friends and a degree that we like will help us to have a more secured and succesful life. Further more if we keep good and respectable relationship with our families we would have a safer life in the future and would know how to offer the family love to our future families amd our own children.

Eventhough there are many things that you can accomplish while you are young some times certain decisions can affect your life in a neggative way.
