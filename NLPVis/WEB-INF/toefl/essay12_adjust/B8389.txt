I don't think we need to plan carefully about my future plan when I am still younger now.

I need to admit that we need to plan the future. Because it is good for you to develop yourself to the aim.

Actually, it is hard for you in the real world. Someone said the plan always farther away from the change. In my mind, the furture plan just as a good dream for me, and it is good for me to choose the major related to the plan.

However, sometimes we need to change our plan. There are unexpect change in my future. If I planed carefully about my previous plan, I would be very sad that I would have to change my plan. It is a good idea to think carefully about my future plan. Sometimes, the plan isn't realtical. 

In my opion, the best way to have a good future for myself is to work hard today. Do not waste everyday. Time flies.
