It's nothing wrong to put emphasis on personal apprearance and fashion. However, it is not appropriate to pay too much attention on them.

First of all, we must place the basic needs-clothes, food, shelter, movement-in the first place. Only if everything meets and exceeds our basic needs for life, one can go ahead and enjoy luxuary stuff, such as fancy skin care and make up products, fashional dresses, BMW cars, so on and so forth. However, on the other hand, imagine if his children still suffer cold, starving, then how can he get rid all of these but enjoy himself in the beach of Los Angels? It is obvious that one can  only pursue fashion stlye life providing that he has enough power to feed his family and live in a good life.

Secondly, even if we are rich enough to enjoy the fancy life, we should not let personal apprerance or fashion beome the core of our life. A successful and meaningful life is defined to having a successful career, providing his family a good and happy life and doing something good for human as a whole, rather than having millions of fancy dresses, owning the most expensive car in the world. Therefore, we should put much emphasis on successful career, but really not simply on presonal appreance or fashion.

It is true that as a human being, it's our nature to pursue beauty, however, that is not our job. We should realize the burden on our shoulder, and do something good and meaningful for our family, our country and our human being as a whole.
