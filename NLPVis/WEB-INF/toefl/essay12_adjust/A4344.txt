The second statement states, "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." I also do agree with this one. This is absulotly correct. these days people put too much care about thier apperunce. there are many reasons might be given for this. One of them is that people are trying to find something make them special and recognized. This is abvious when we look at young age generation; especially the females. They pay too much attention to the stuff that are related to their appearunce. As said before this is becuase of the need to be recogrnized. For a teenager, it feels really good when they are recognized and been uniqely treated. Not only teenagers, but all generation. However, as older we get as careless we are about such things. This is becuase we start understanding the around world more. And so, it is not important for us how to we look like becuase we understand that being recognized by our appearance is not the best way to be recognized. However, for sure we still care about our looks, but not too much.
Another reason for such emphisiign is the enviroment around us. These days it is rapidly increasing how much we care about our look and how much we want to follow the fashion. for some people, they want to be recognized as mentioned before, but for others, it is nothing about being recognized as fashioned person. It is more about trying to keep up with the others. These days if a young girl wore an old fashion dress and went to her friends party, she would be wired and everybody laugh at her. Not becuase of the dress, but becuase of the time she is wearing that dress.
Appearance and fashion are important factors to live within a comunity, so we have to care about them if we do not want to be treated as strangers of that community.
