People put too much emphasis on appearance and fashion? The positive evidences are easily to be listed. David Beckam, the most famous soccer player, can not be listed in the best 50 players of the world. But why does his name know to almost everyone in Europe and Asia? Why are so many girls crazy for him, even when we notice that some of them do not watch a single match? Although not denying that Beckham is indeed a very good player, we  have to attribute his success, at least partially to his hamesome face, and his fashionable dresses. And many surveys also show that, people with pretty faces and appearances tend to be more successful in their career, without obviously better abilities. 

So, can we say appearances are the only reason when people are judging a person? Definitely not. Let me look at the example of David Beckham again. With huge amount of fans, Beckham is force by many advertising companies and sponsors to be the key player of Real Madrid, who bought him at a price of more than 50 million dollars. But after half a season of bad ranking in the league, people find that in the matches without Beckham, Real Madrid seems to be more competitive and appears as a stronger team. So the next half season, Beckham is put as a substitute player. And with the pressure of getting a champnion, Beckham’s fans can not say much words. So this is a appropriate example that people do not judge person just from appearance. 

Here is another question, is it good to put emphasis on people’s looking? To some extent, this emphasize is reasonable. Appearance can reflect people’s inside. What dress does a person wearing can also show his taste to fashion. So when we are looking for friends, rock fans will prefer those ones with typical wearing. Appearance will classify different persons. So it is nothing to complain when noticing that people put emphasis much on appearance.
