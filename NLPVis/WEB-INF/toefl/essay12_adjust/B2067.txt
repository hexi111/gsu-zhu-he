There is old saying in my country: plans alwasy try to catch up changes.  From my perspective as a student, I don't agree with the idea that we should plan our future carefully when we are young to ensure a good future.  In contrast, I believe that things are not always follow the way we want.  That is to say, it doesn't ensure that you will have good futune when you plan your future, and there is no cause-effect relationship between good futune and plan future.  Furthermore, it has many reasons and causes to led good future not only planing carefully.  On the other hand, even you plan carefully for your future life, it is possible that there are so many protential and unpredicted causes that impede the way of good future.  Take Bill Gates, the funder of the Microsoft software, for instant, he didn't know that he will be make a lot of money when he was in the college.  Even he didn't forsee that he would be kick out by the college.  However, Bill Gates successed in few years ago and I think he didn't plan to kicked by the college and stop the college life.  Therefore, based on this example, I believe that the best way to ensure a good future for ourself is not rely on planing carefully when we are young.
