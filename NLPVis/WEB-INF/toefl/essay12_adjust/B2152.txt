everyone has lots of dreams when he or she is young. For me, when I was a little child, I hoped I could become a "Superman" in the future. But time can change people a little by a little. people have different plans in different periods. 

Everyone has his or her own future. He or she can plan for good future at anytime, because time is changing and the world is changing too. we can never know what will happen tomorrow. so someone said,"The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young." I think it is feasible.

the first reason why I support this point is that the length of a person`s life is really short and there is no enough time for people to change everyday or plan different things everyday.   nowadays, the world goes very fast. new creatures  come into the world everyday. a people can never set the same pace to the changing world. So it will make people tired to only plan matters. what people should do is to find what he or she likes to do and to make them come true in the future. 

the second reason is that the youth is the vital period for anybody. people complete a large number things in this period, such as study, working, and so on. A good plan is the most significant thing because it determines the life of a person in the future. something people need to do when they are young and there is no chance to do it when they get old. 

All in all, the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.
