People nowadays are very concerned about their own future. Some of them plan their own life since they were young, so that, they can follow their path to succeed. However, some of them prefer to go on with their life first before deciding their own future. It is all depended on the way we manage our own life in the future. However, I do agree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for ourselves is to plan carefully while we are still young. There are several reasons why we should do that.

First and for most, by planning our future while we are still young, we can know exactly what we are going to do in the future in order to achieve our ambition. By having an ambition since we still young, we are able to know what kind of degree that we should be succeeded in, for example, in order to achieve our goal. We can also know the requierements that we need to pursue in our studies so that we can graduate successfully and we know the way that we should be after graduating. We can exactly focus on what we want so that we will not easily lose while we are on the track to succeed.

Secondly, early future planning can somehow motivate ourselves to struggle more and study hard to achieve our target. This kind of motivation can help us to become more focused in our study. For example, whenever we decide that we want to be a doctor, we are encourage to study more especially on Biology or any other courses that are related to become a doctor because we know that's what we want to be in the future. Either we like it or not, we have to study that course because we know it will be really useful in our future then.

In conclusion, the best way to ensure a good future to ourselves is to plan everything carefully while we're still young because by planning it we can  know our focus, plus, we can motivate ourselves. However, to have a good future we need to follow our own dreams not by other's hope.
