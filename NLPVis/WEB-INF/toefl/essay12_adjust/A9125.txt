     The statement is: "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." Since the details are not provided, I present my viewpoint for this statement taking the history of fashion in Japan, 800s and 2000, into consideration. In particular, I focus on the women from the higher-middle class family between these two periods. In the provided context, I disagree with the above statement. The emphasis on women's personal appearance and fashion seems to be reduced in 2000s, compared to the women in 800s.

     First, it can be explained by the role of women in the society.a number of women from the wealthy higher-middle class family served the royal family. Given that it was considered to be most honorable to marry the emperor, the women did their best to maintain their beauty, appearance, fashion, and culture. Considering the shift in the role of women in 2000s, the emphasis on personal appearance and fashion declined. 

     Second, the role of personal appearance and fashion have been shifted. In 800s, personal appearance and fashion were crucial to women in order to be loved by the emperor. However, in the modern society, personal appearance and fashion can be used as a few of the components for self expression. It is not alway necessary for women to put emphasis on personal appearance or fashion to express themselves.

     As illustrated above, at least in the comparison of women from higher middle class family in 800s and 2000s in Japan, the statement does not appear to be true. However, it is possible that the statement can be applied in different contexts.
