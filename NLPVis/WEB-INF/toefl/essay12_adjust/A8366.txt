People nowaday put their time on clothings and make-up much more than doing homeworks or studying. In college, I have seen more students holding fashion magazines, such as "Seventeen" or "Cosmogirls" than textbooks. In my work office, I have seen receptionists looking at mirrors more often than at their checks. As a college student and a receptionist at doctor's clinic, my surroundings are telling me that people does put too much emphasis on personel appearance and fashion. 

Students in college and in any other school, female and male are so concerned about their over-all appearances. Many of these students believed that better outfits or hairstyles gave them confidence, or for some people just to impress one or the other. Many college students even if they are late, spend one or two hours just to put make-up on their face before attending classes. Some people spend more time shopping than studying for their  tests or midterms.  This new generation are most targeted by the media because fashion magazines and television shows are too abundent and widespread. 

My co-workers have spend over thousands of dollars shopping at SOHO. Everday they would walk in the door with different eyeshadows and lip-glosses, and crazy outifts. I was impressed with how much they are willing to spent for those make-up and outfits. Sometimes I asked them if all these make-up worth thoser thousands of dollars, but they told me that confidence are priceless.

Personally I am the new generation, and I acted the same. I also believe that people do put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion, because no matter where you go, you can see everything are related to appearances, commercials that are always using attractive females or males to sell their products. Fashion industry uses models to demonstrate their new season designs. Fashion has become a part of our daily exsistence.
