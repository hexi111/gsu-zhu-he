I agree the above statement that we should prepare our future while we are still young. First, we are living in a competitive world which is very hard to make a good future because of the harsh living conditions. Most people  try to do their best in order to ensure a good future and they are very aware of the fact that they should make plans and save money in case of emergent situations they may access. 

Next, people can be very hardworking and have fresh minds when they are young. We can cope with the difficulties more easily because of our strength.But, when we become old we will be too tired of the problems of world and we will need some relax and comfort in our rest of life. if we do not make plans for our future, we cannot get that comfort.

Then, as my mum says we are always trying to do something for our next generation. when we get married and if we have children we begin to think about their future and save money in order for them to be educated and have a better life.

Furthermore, life is not so easy to live the moment. rather, it is too complex and has many dynamics to consider about. Unless we do plans we will not get much about our work and our ambitious studies we do while we are still young. Therefore, time management is one of the most important skills we should have in this new world. For example, I have a weekly schedule and I try to note down what should I to do in that week. When I forget to do this I generally cannot remember my responsibilities and waste my time in vain. This is a best try to gain skills about planning the future of your life.

In conclusion, we should always think about our future and make conscious and reasonable plans to make our future comfortable and to be in safe. it is of vital importance to take back what we did while we were young.
