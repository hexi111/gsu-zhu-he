Nowadays, the media and the public have put too much emphasis on the personal outlook and fashion. In my home country, we have hundreds of kinds of fashion magazines to read and thousands of websites talk about trend-related topics. This phenomenon results in several side-effects: 1. the teenagers spend too much time on their appearance; 2. they will spend too much money on dress or accessories; 3. people start to value exterior more than the interior of a person. 
    
First of all, fashion news have driven too many people spending a lot of their personal time consuming those news. I usually spend about two hours a day to read articles teaching you how to make up or how to dress up to kill men. I can't help but still continue to read those things, putting my school studies aside. 
    
Second, the more fashion news you read, the more you would spend for chic looking. After I read an article discussing a very effective facial lotion or a strongly waterproof mascara, there will be a high potentiality for me to try them out. This kind of behavior happens all the time and I always spend about more than $200 each month on cosmetics or costumes. 
   
Finally, because of the media keeps reporting about the fashions news, people start to shift their focus on appearance more than their inside. They tend to judge a person from his or her outlook instead of talking to them first in order to know them better. People will have a higher tendency to make judgement by outlooking in the future if the mass media still emphasizing more on fashion.
    
In a nutshell, an overload of fashion news in the modern society has made too many people spend too much time as well as money on it. Furthermore, people begin to judge a person by his or her exterior more than by his or her interior. The mass media should really take some actions to stop spreading fashion ideas to the public.
