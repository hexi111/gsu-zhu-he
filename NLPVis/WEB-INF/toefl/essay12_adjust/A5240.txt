i disagree to this proposition.

consumerism is developing worldwide. in the process of modernity, people are imitating west, especially this is the case with developing countries. They want to imaitatte the west interms of fashions and behaviors. in the case of west they are in the process of changeing fashons too fast.

if we look at the expenditures of people, now consumerstatistics telling that after houseing people are apending more on dresses and costumes. in the case of developing countries, this situation is bit different. there once, peoples income starts increseing there spending on fashons like dresses and appearance is increasing.

in inda, after softwere revolution, one can witness the difference. the number of studios has increased, people expenditure in beauty parlours and cosmotics has increased tremoundously. interestingly beauty parlors for men and fitness centres has increased. once it was a rare phenomenon.

we can see two principle reasons for this, one as needs for industry has changed. nowadays companys are prefering smart and talkative individuals. this encorageing both men and women to meet these needs. another reason is industries manufactureing conmotics are encorageing this phenomenon inodder to increase there sales. the fashon shows and beauty contests are different components in this direction. in the year 1994, two indian girls has become miss universe and miss world according to one survey, the sales of revlon has increased 100 times with in a year. this shows how people preferences are changeing.

it is very difficult to jucge or conclude, weather this phenomenon is good or bad. these are all part and parcil of development. similar phenomenon was witnessed by wet might be some 100 years back, so now the devloping world is doing the similar thing. but this phenomenon is generating new jobs, so this should be appriciated.
