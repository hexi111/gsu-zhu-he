Unfortunately, since visual media is becoming more and more preferred over the written, and since the current global norms on social values focusing on individual gains over others, people are putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

We live in a world of "me". It might be the consumer-driven  commercialism, mandating us to put ourselves, our looks, our lives, our needs above anything else, or it might just be the side-effect of "work-aholism", constantly producing individuals with few unique hobbies and preferences, few fulfilling outlets to experience their individuality, but one thing is certain: The amount of resources and time spent in modern societies on personal looks has reached the levels of a full-blown mass hysteria.

This hysteria seems also to gain strength and new life force from the speed of communication. Thanks to the information superhighways leading to every corners or our homes, the popular culture has become an ever-changing chameleon. The trends in fashion are the semi-trucks of this superhighway; they are gone even before you can see them, but the noise, the rumble, the pollution they create stay with you even after they leave.

Especially teenagers fall victim to this process. With every new popular idol or style, they change, just to end up looking exactly the same as the majority of their age group.

The adults are not without blame either. Not only are they allowing the young minds of next generations fall victim into this process, but they also encourage it, and even follow it in their own lives.

We put an extensive amount of time and effort into their personal looks, all in the name of individuality, yet they seem to lose more of their individuality at each step.
