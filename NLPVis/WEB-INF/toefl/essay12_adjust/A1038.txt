The question of "personal appearance and fashion" has fueled the both public and private debates in various parts of the world. I can still remember one of my High School classmates express with a certain pride: "I dress (up) according to my mood". She was saying this in response to critics according to which she put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Yes, I agree with the statement that "too much emphasis is put on personal appearance and fashion" nowadays.

I know people who spend all their fortune including their family budget to buy clothes and jewels just to arrange their appearance or to satisfy the latest fashion. Many reasons explain such a phenomena. First, human beings are usually concerned with personal appearance. I remember this Bible story in Samuel. A king had to be chosen for Israel. When the man of GOD went to the house of the future king, he chose many people according to their appearance. But GOD said: Man looks to the appearance but I look to the heart". Secondly, the world is in a very advanced stage of its development. Goods are produced in large quantities with varying qualities. These goods need to be sold out. So, many marketing strategies are developed to get them sold. "Weak" people cannot resist the fascination exerted on them by highly sophiscated commercials. People will do whatever to get the goods.

So the statement is true but with this difference. If, in the past, people could have the same opportunity we have today, they could behave as we are doing today. So, it not so much a problem of today. It's related to human nature.
