Nowadays personal appearance and fashion are an important economic activity in developed countries. Clothing and beauty supplies (make-up, hair color and so on) are an increasing part of one's revenues. This obviously shows that people do emphasize on personal appearance. 

I do not think that people put too much emphasize on it. However I do not think that people should emphasize more on personal appearance either. People like to take care of themselves and follow the day's fashion, and they have always done so. It is a way of showing that they are part of a social group of a certain time. People are now able to emphasize this much on personal appearance because the weight of other factors such as food and heating in their budget has considerably decreased. People can now spend proportionally more on fashion and culture. In the past centuries, only the few rich people coud emphasize as it is done today on personal appearance and fashion; the poor had to focus mainly on working enough to eat all year long. But even they had their own fashion, with certain sewings on their clothes or certain hats for example. 

Nowadays, with the globalization, clothes price has tremendously decreased, so that almost everyone now, in developed countries, can follow a certain fashion and show its social identity, and can evolve with time. People are just a part of society, and have to follow the group's rules.
