In principle I do not think that there is a clear answer to the question of whether a good future is a function of how early you start to plan things. On the one hand, youth should be enjoyed: it is a time for trying, erring and learning and should not be make worse by adding the anxiety of an uncertain future. On the other hand, however, to have a fool live just when you are in your formation years can have profound consequences in the future.

From a more personal stand, I would add that more important than planning ahead, is to develop the ability of taking risks and being in the lookout for opportunities that can eventually lead to a better future. It is perhaps more important to be able to embark in a schoolo loan, than to be an excellent student totally risk averse. Can be more rewarding to have the flexibility to move around and get out of your comfort zone, that just avoid change becasue of the fear to the unknown.

That being said, I do not think that a crazy life whit the unltimate purpose of being happy and try to avoid pain, responsability and reality would help either. Being bouncing from one place to other because you do not know what to do with your life can barely being used as an excuse to say that you are flexible and open to new opportunities.

In summary, I would agree with the fact that some planning at an early life stage is needed for a good future, however it should take the form of developing a character able to cope with the miriad of changes in life, rather than hopelessly worrying about the unknown complexities of tomorrow. At the end they are just that, unknown.
