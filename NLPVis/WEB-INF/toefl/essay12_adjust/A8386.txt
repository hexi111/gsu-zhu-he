I don't agree this statement. I think everybody just follow the trend or what is popular, even on TV I can see only same sytle. 

For example, hip-hop music became very popular in many countries recently, but everybody have same style. They wear the long T-shirt, cap and jeans. It is thier style, but everybody is the same. The people who like hip-hop are also the same style.

Other example, I can see it in Japan. Their personality is that they should follow other people. Especially among young people, they are wearing exactlly same close when they go to work or interview. For the interview, they should show their personality and make a splash, they have to give the impression to the interviewer, and bigining term of working as well. However, they don't do that. They just wear the dark gray suits and just follow what other people do.

Recently,I can see many people who have tatoo or pias on some of the part of body. In the past, I could see the totoo only the mafia of gang had it. I think it become more common than before.  

Today, there are many information , and we can see the many style. However everybody just follows the trend, so I don't think people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fasion.
