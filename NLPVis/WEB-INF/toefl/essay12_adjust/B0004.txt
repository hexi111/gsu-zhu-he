 It apears to be a common concern for every single individual to offer her/himself a better life. When  one should start planning  to secure a good future remains a debatable issue depending on visions people have of their  life.

     Some people would easily agree that "the best way is to start planning while still young". 
This seems very reasonable because youth is the period of life-time during which one has all the potentials humans have been endowed. The worse ennemy of humans is time. Indeed as time elapses through days, months, years and decades humans grow older and older; then become impotent or unqualified for certain activities. It's the law of nature. That is the reason why it is better to take advantage of youth in order to have a clear vision of one's life.
     However we should not ignore the arguments of those who rely on chance or fate, that is destiny. It might not realistic for the supporters of the previous viewpoint but in the course of history it has been observed that early and careful planning is not always synonym of "good future". Sometimes all the plans go by the drain. Should we infer that we should not take any initiative at all?  

    The answer is definitely negative; and the earlier the better, even though youth does not always go with wisdom there are good reasons to try.
