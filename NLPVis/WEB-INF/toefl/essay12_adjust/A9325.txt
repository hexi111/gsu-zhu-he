I agree the statement that many people put too much focus on their appearance nowadays but I think that is not a bad effect for the society. How to dress up is a personal choice and it should get any critized. I am just personally feel that more people in the society will take people's outlook and appearance into their consideration in many occassion such as job interviewing , searching a relationship and friendship. 

People are willing to spend money on things that will benefit them and appearance could be one of the examples. A good outlook might give them some advantages on their job or relationship. But nowadays, it is too much desire around us. Two effect might be the reason that people pay a lo attention on their appearance. The first one is media, Media helps the market to sell the goods for customer in their advertising and they are the main stream of fashion. The media can deside the way of fashion so that when customers see an ad then they they will consider that is fashion. 

Another reason that cause people pay more attention on appearing is that people face their faith from the inside to outside. The outlook give them more opportinuties to get the chance of job or to close a friend than their inside and mind. This is because the society and the whole environment is changing. Just like I am saying earlier, outlook will grade their ability in some situation.

The last point I would like to argue is that over emphisizing the outside appearance is not very benefical to whole society. If everyone is depending on the outlook to decide what the personility that person is, the society is going to be worse and worse. That is to say, outlook is important but can not be the only one way to decide a person's personality and ability as well.
Since this arguement, these people who emphasie too much appearance should correct their thought and consider their inside such as their talent,working ability and personality,,and so on.
