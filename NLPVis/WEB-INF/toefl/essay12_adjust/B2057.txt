Future is unpredicable. To ensure you a good life in the coming days, I think the best policy is to plan carefully while you are still young.

Planning while your are young because you have a lot of choices then. Since  you are just standing at the beginning of your life, everything is possible. You can study hard to get into a academic field to discover something. You can pick up a sport you like such as mountain climbing, backpacking and surfing. You can also try travel around the world to feel the beauty of diverse cultures. Choices are so many when you are young. Everyone should cherish the good time and plan carefully for their future.

Planning while you are young because it helps you to gain a clear picture of what you are really interested. Some people spend a lot of time in computer games. I think it is common in the modern society. However, many of them will regreted thier choices when they get involved in the society. Because they will realize they have so many things to do and their time are so limited. They devoted all day long in computer games when they are young just to kill time. You can imagine how some of them will be when they realize the fact. Planning young and planning in advance, you will know what to do and what you need in the future.

Planning while you are young because you still have chances to make up for what you once did. People always make stupid decisions which will destory their lives to some extent. However, once they plan your life while they are young, it can reduce the hurt of the terrible results. Since young people still have lots of time to live, they can always back to the right path of their life in the next intersection. Youth give them lots of chances to correct faults.

Everyone hope a good life. I think the best policy is to achieve your own goal is to plan while you are young.
