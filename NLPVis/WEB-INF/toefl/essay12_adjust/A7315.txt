It is true that nowadays people put more and more emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. In the old days people spend less time on their appearence when they went to meet people or participate some events. The fashion was not a great part of people's life.However,things changed a lot now.People consider more and more about fashion and their appearence.It is not unusual to find there are fashion magezines,fashion shows,advertisements and so on everywhere in our daily life. Before going out,people waste more time on their appearences:make-up,select clothes,chang hairstyle...They really are more emphasized on their physical looking.

However,I do not think they overdo this kind of things.There is nothing wrong to make yourseld more attractive.It is always good to make yourself in a good appearence.This makes you feel confortable and more confident ,meanwhile it is a way to show your respection to the others.Good appearence can bring you a lot of benifits.It can help you make more friends .That because you can have more topics to talk with your friends like:cloth brands,superstars,fashion trends so on and so forth.Somethimes it also can bring success to you.If under a commercial situation,who do you think will be more likely to get the customers,the one who wear poorly and out of fashion or those who wear very suitable and fashional.I think it should be the latter.Although there are really more and more things appear in our society related to people's appearence and fashion,yet it is not more than enough.It does not disturb our regular daily life.So it is all right to put more emphasis on personal appearence and fashion.

In a word,people indeed take their appearence and fashion more serious but that's not too much. That's really something we need to do during our daily life.
