Basically,I think it is somewhat a good way to plan carefully when we are still young to make sure we'll have a bright future.

Although we do not know what will it turns to be tomorrow, yet we can do some preparation for it. When we are teenages we could have a blueprint for our future.Then we can get a target for whatever we want to be in the future. Take me as an example, I want to be an engineering in the future.Hence, I choose my major ---mechanical engineering. After that I find that America is a better place for engineering education,then I came to America to continue my study.This maybe can can not guarantee me to be an engineer, but It at least can give me the chance to be one. Once I have this planned then I have to work hard for it to get to the destination.It is always a good thing that you find you have a target and you get things planned before you start to do it.

However ,there are a lot of unknowns in our life. We can hardly say what will happen next minute.It is good to get prepare for it. Nevertheless, if the situation is not the same as we expected before we still should be optimistic. For example,you have a plan to be a althelete in the future.But once you have a slight accident which make you can not have any tensive activitied after that.Then your plan should be totally changed.Would you still stick to it?No. This time you will think plans made at young age is useless.

All in all, to be planned for the future is good than no plan at all.However we have no need to put too much importance on the plans. We should be more flexible to that.Then our life can be happier.
