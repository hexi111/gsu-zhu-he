I don't fully agree with the statement.  

First, to have a carefully designed plan doesn't always help you to obtain a better future of your career or your family life.  Life keeps changing, the world around keeps changing, and you will never know what will happen in the far future. For example, you want to make a good money and you have designed a very detailed plan to achieve this dream. You buy stocks, very carefully, you invest in the hot technical industry, etc. but bad things still happen no matter you like it or not.  

Second, assume you have a good luck and the your outside world follows the exact way you think, i.e. the conditions in your plan do not change with time.  To have a plan is still not sufficient enough to succeed. You have to stick to your plan, you have to work on it day by day, and you can't give it up easily.  

In my opion, although it is often good to have a plan when you are young, you have to work hard, stick to your plan but sometimes you also need to change the plan to overcome the ever-changing world.
