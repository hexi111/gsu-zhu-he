What is the best way to guarantee a good future? Some people think they should plan carefully when they are still young. Personally, I do not think it is wrong to start planning early - by planning properly in advance, you can start earlier on the "right" track and may achieve the final goal sooner than others. But is it absolutely the best way for success? Maybe not always true. Here is what I think.

Firstly, when people are young, they do not really know what is best for them. They might have interest in various subjects and it takes some time for them to figure out what suits them best. For instance, tt is very common to see students switch majors in college. So, we might have had an incorrect perception about our interest and if we decide what we should do when we are still young, we probably will make big mistakes about the life planning.

Secondly, not only people are changing their ideas, things also change. The initial plan will get out-of-date compared with five or ten years ago when you plan it. We need to adjust our plan accordingly with the situation. There's no way of predicting how everything will be in the future. 

By stating the above two reasons, I have stated why I do not agree that the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully at an early stage. However, I do think that it is important to have a plan for the future, maybe not a very exact detailed plan. People become more motivated when they have a plan for guidance. Hence, the best way to make sure that you will have a good future for yourself is to plan properly and make appropriate adjustment when needed.
