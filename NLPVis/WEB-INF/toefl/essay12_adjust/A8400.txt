Nowadays we can see beautiful or fashionable people easily. That means there are many people who have a good appearance. some people say that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. However, I strongly disagree with that reason because of following two reasons. The one is that there is more important thing than appearances which is a real mind. the other is that plastic surgery become more and more because of such a social atmosphere.

The first of all, people should be judged by their personality or their mind. Of course the first impression which is a fashion or an appearance is important thing. However, we have to catch their each characteristic. 

In addition, because of such an emphasized matter, the rate of plastic surgery is increasing more and more. The serious problem is its later. Many people suffer from the later problem of the surgery. Nowadays, it is not only women's case but also men's case. Imagine their appearance when they are old. How articial !

In conclusion, I disagree with following statement which is putting extremely emphsis on personal appearance and fashion. Because I believe that people's mind is more important than personal appearance or fashion. And also it is serious problem that the later problem of a plastic surgery become increasing. Therefore, we should focus on people's mind and their personality.
