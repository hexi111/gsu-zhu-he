Is it true that the person who has great appearance has more ability to do anything? Many people might not agree with the word, but almost people would behavier like that is true. However, I think that the people misunderstand that the most important is not their appeearance or fashion but their characteristic.

When we meet some people and we estimate the people,  the first appearance is important though their appearance could not tell about their everything. However, even though the empression effects our thinking so much, by meeting them continuously, we can change our estimation to them. For example, when we think about your best friend, if you think about the time you met him/her, it might be totally different from now your thinking. If your friend has bad characterisitic or behaviers, your best friend might be another person. Thus, To make our interior appearacne more beatiful and great is more important than to emphasis on personal apperance.

If we have a good characteristic and we have good appearance and fashion, it is the best way to live. For example, let's imegine someone get a job because of his/her appearance and style. The company expects that the person would work hard and he/she bring high benefits to the company. Every day the person may be facused, and his/her ability will be overestiamated by his/her surroundings. If the person makes some tiny mistake, it would look like a serious problem. Hence, the important thing is to high our ability but not to look like a superman or a wonderwoman.

Every year, the people who have cosmatic operation are increased. But, I'm wondering they will think their interior appearance as much as they think about their looking. Therefore, we need to increase our ability and to develop our good charteristic.
