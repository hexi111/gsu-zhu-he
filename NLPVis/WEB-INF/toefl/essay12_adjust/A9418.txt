In case of Japan, young people tend to spend a lot of money and time to make themselves look good. For example, high school students, who I personally know through an athletic club activity, took more than one hour to take shower, wash their faces, put hair cream and check their appearance after finishing training. I would say "What's the point to take so much time to wash your face? You will go home and take another shower anyway in a couple of hours!" Their responses were always "You never know what would happened on the way back home. What if I happened to see my girl friend and smell really bad." I wished they were well-prepared persons  in their academic fields as such.
  
On the contrary, when I look around students in the US, they don't look concerned about their appearance as much as young Japanese do. They wear more casual clothes in school, and they seem to put more importance on their personalities. At least I have never heard of US students saying "You never know who I will come across on my way home." They would say "I would rather spend more time to exercise if I had another one hour."
 
Personally, I prefer the way the US people might think of. Young people should spend more time and energy to develop their internal personalities and enjoy whatever helps to enhance their skills in any field. Because I think that is what only young people can/have to do in their early stage of their lives.
