Nowadays, people does put a lot emphasis on personal appearance and fashion especially in industrialized countries such as the United States. However, too much is not the appropriates words that I would use to describe it. 

In this highly competitive century, everyone in this society has to do everything they are capable to do and try as hard as they can to achieve their goals in both career and personal life. When college education can no longer make a person standing out  among others, personal appearance begins to take another major role in everyone's daily life. People have been taught that one cannot judge the other one from appearance, but judging people from looking is part of human nature. Psychologically, human are fond of things that look more comfortable to them, even though people intend to control this natural feeling. 

As many argue that the real skill, experience, and personality should play a bigger role in pursue goals. I could not disagree with that. But, among all the factors, personal appearance is the first one that comes in front of people. Before you can have others notice your skill, experience, and personality, personal appearance has to impressive at the first place. 

Each country or even each ethical group has its own culture. And from time to time, they are so different that conflict could be taken place. However, a emphasis on personal appearance is always considered as respect and polite world wide. 

As the conclusion, a heavy emphasis on appearance is not too much, and it is reasonable and rational in the current world.
