Why do you spend more than $100 on a new coat, or buy that new perfum at $80? It is saying that newdays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I totally agree with this statement. The reason for the improtance of appearance and fashion lies three aspects. 

First, you are so easily judged by your appearance when you first time meeting with people. It is right. You and a stranger met each other. You know nothing about him/her, and he/she completely has no clue about you. The appearance and fashion somehow at this time become a proxy for your personal characteriscs. You could be labled as "neat", "cute", "sharp" or "nesty" by your appearance. Job interview is good example for such case. You want to look as smart and perfessional, then wear the buisness suit.

Second, appearance and fashion do resemble peoople's personality. It is hard to imagine a person who is wearing a clean shirt and polished shoes has a messy working table. It is also difficult to believe your co-work who hasn't change his clothes for weeks is a orgnized person. To most people, the nice appearance and a decent tast of fashion means the energy for the life. 

Last but not the least, people tend to associate a person's appearance and fashion with something larger and biger, for example the social status and wealth. This perception is an important explaination for the more emphasis people weight appearance and fashion. I do not want to judge this perceipton is right or wrong, but people do such way indeed.
