I do not agree with this statment. I think that people not put too much emphasis an personal appearance and fashion. these are two reasons.

firstly, people just follow the up date fashion and they do not have orignalty. for exsample, I like to go shopping and I go to window shopping very much but I always buy cloths look like that everyone wear. And I can see people on the street who are wearing  their clothes look like same.

secondly. we can not reconaize theri posonality with appearance. for exsample, when my friends introduced his friend to me, he looked very scary me because he was wearing kind of lether fashion and I thouth about him, he was really agrrasive poeson but he was really nice to me. his poersanality di d not much his fashion. he did not care about fishion.

in conclision, In my opinion, I do not think people put too much emphasis on personal fashion. they just follow other people and they just wear clothes what they want.
