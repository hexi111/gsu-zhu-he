It is probably truth that people take lot of attention at the appearance. For instance when people go to the mall or supemarket a lot of people chose to buy some clothes that they will be sure that they are fashion or that the impact of the clothes will be good with friends or other people.

Probably at school and the american university students do not take attention at the appearance that is to say a majority of people who prefer wear some jogging pants and huge sweaters which is for me the contrary of a fashionable way.

It is evident that the personal count in the life for example when you present at an interview majority of people wear some good clothes and care their appearance, in an interview people wear a suit and try to care the vocabulary. A person who goes to an interview for an office in a company will not be dirty with lot of piercings and tatoo, if for the same job a person with the same compentence arrive but without piercings and tatoos, and if at the contrary he wears a suit casual. The boss of the society will choose the second candidat eventhough the other person it is very competitive and probably apt for the job.

I think that everybody tries to show a kind of image. It is very frequent to meet someone who wears some kinds of clothes just for seeming like a pop star or a fashion manequin same if this person does not really like the clothe. But she wears that, just because such or such people wear it.

It is not the best manner to want immitate someone. I think everyone has his own personality and for represent the personality it is not good to want wearing something which does not reflect himself.

The important in the life is to be happy and if people are happy when they look their appeaence in the miror, it is a good way for them.

Everyday when we go to school, to work or in the supermarket we are confront at the opinion. I think to feel good the best way is to avoid the thinking of the other people and just believe in us.
