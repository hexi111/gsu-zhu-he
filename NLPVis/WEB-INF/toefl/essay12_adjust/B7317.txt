I agree with the opinion that the best way to ensure  a good future for oneself is to plan carefully while we are still young. I have three reasons for this opinion.

Firstly, it is the best time for you to learn something when you are young. Therefore, you should prepare your future when you are young. Suppose you want to be a physics scientist. Do you think you can be a physics scientist when you suddenly decide to be one when you are 60 years old, while you know nothing about physics? I think it is possible. However, there may be someone who have a good future and did not plan carefully when he is young. I will say there may be such special cases, but most successful 
people plan carefully when they are young.

Secondly, sometimes to have a good future is not a easy task. It needs a lot of work and a lot time to spare. For example, be a pianist needs a lot of 
pracitce. People spend a lot of years to become a pianist finally. Many pianist begin to play the piano when they are a very young child. Therefore, some kinds of career really need to plan early.

Finally, sometimes you will find that you are not fit for something. Then it is very important to make a careful plan early. For example, many pianist really have a tanlet for that. They really find their talent when they are young. If someone have no talent for piano but may become a great scientist for phsics, he should not continue to try to be a pianist. It is somewhat a waste of time. If he changes to learn physics, he may be very 
successful. Therefore, he should make a plan very early.

From all above, we see that we need to plan eary in order to be very successful in the future.
