Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. People buy really expensive clothes and spend enormous time in front of mirror. Most of those money and efforts are useless because the real value of person is not related to their appearance and fashion.

Some people think that good appearance and fashion bring success. However, it is not true. The success is related to their ability and effort rather than their appearance. For example, if you give good apperance but no ability, you can have good chance but will be quited very shortly. The appearance can bring you good chance but no succeed. Therefore, you should strive to have better ability rather than appearance.

Another reason for putting too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion is bad is because it cost too much money, time, and effort. As I mentioned, good appearance can bring you chance but without ability you will fail. However, trying to have good appearance cost enormous time, effort, and money. It is very hard to have both good appearance and good ability. Therefore, when people try to have good appearence they are spending precious time, effort, and money to useless thing rather than important. 

In conclusion, I think that people are using too much effort on personal appearance and fashion because it is not really important things and because of that they are loosing their time, effort and money for real valueble things.
