I agree with the idea that people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion these days for the following reasons.
            
First, people use too much money on their cloths and accesaries.  There are a lot of expencive fashion stores which only rich people can afford to buy cloths and accesaries from. Appearence is like the symbol of whelthiness for some of the people which i don't bileave.
           
Second, people try too much to copy famous movie stars and singers who care a lot about appearance and fashion. for example, there is a famous singer 'Namie Amuro' in Japan. Many young people tried to imitate her fashion and the 'Amurer phenomenon' emarged. the people who are imitating her fashion were called 'amurer'. It might interesting, however, each person's individual charactor disappers.

Third, most important thing for people to care about is not appearance and fashion but their personality I bileave. People should care more about inside of theirselves.
            
Thus, I think people care about their appearance and fashion too much. I don't think it is bad to care about appearence and fashion but people need to care about their peasonality too.
