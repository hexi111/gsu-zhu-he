I disagree.

Personal appearance is always important. As the world is more and more commercialized, it is normal that fashion is playing an important role. But I don't think people are putting too much emphasis on that. 

Let's have a look at the history. Historically, European people spent lots of time on their appearance. As I know, some noble ladies needed several hours to dress up. Nowadays, in the modern world, people have more entertainment. So I think people are not putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. On the opposite, people are taking withdrawing attention from fashion to other areas.
