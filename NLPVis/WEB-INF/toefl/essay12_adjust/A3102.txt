Today fashion has become  the part of our lifestlye. Everyone wants to be fashionalby dressed. I agree with the statement that " nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion."

There are number of reasons why dressing up is important. Firstly, as is said "first impression is the last impression" so when you meet a person, you want to give him good impression about yourself.For instance if you have a meeting with a business client and you go dressed up in jeans and tshirt, the first impression he will get is " this person is not serious" instead if yo go wearing a business suit or business casual the client will think that he is meeting a professioanal. Similarly we are in taught in school that when you go for a job interview, wear professional clothes, it kind of giving the other person impression that you are serious.

Secondly, the way the media and fashion industry advertises, its considered cool to wear clothes like celebrities.The retail outlets here target different consumer with their ideal celebrity. For example, Kelly clarkson, is  teenage and young girls ideal so the companies will use her in advertising their products. As a  result teenage girls will want to wear that too, because their ideal uses that product too. United states corporations are very good in marketing and advertising and hence fashion has become so important. 

On the contrary, emphasing mainly on appearence and fashion has disadvantages also. There are some people who have talent and know how to do their job, but because they are not fashionable, they do not  fit in the organization and sometimes they loose good opportunities in life.

In the end, i think overall personal appearence does matter. Fashion is ok, its more materialistic thing. One should know how to market themshelves with their appearence and knowledge even though they are not fashionable.
