I totally agree that the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully while you are young.

I think that today each and every economy in the world is facing a lot of competition and it is very hard to survive in this competitive world. 

Today the younger generation should plan their future carefully so that they can stand in the market on their own and they can survive in this competitive world. Today most of the college students are unclear about what they want to do in their future. They even do not know in what major they want to graduate. This carelessness and taking their future lightly may make them cry in the future.

One should always be ready for the future and should make their decision of what they want to do in future in their high-school. So that, they can choose their major in the college accordingly and think about the career opportunities in that field. This advanced thinking of future will help the younger generation in establishing their foot firmly in the market and to be successful in life.
