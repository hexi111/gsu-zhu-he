There is a hot topic to agure recently, it is about that "The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young." After a deep consideration, I tend to disagree this statement. It is beause it will relatively create a barrier to many good chances for everyone's life; and no one should be fixed by a plan which made by an immature mind. I will explain the detail reason in the following.

First of all, it will create a barrier between you and good chances. When we were fixed by the plan made in young age, we would not try to access something new which encounter in our growing life; and we will probably omit the chance when it comes to face. So your development will narrow down by that young plan. 
Therefore, I do not agree this statement

In addition,  our interest is not fixed when we were young. Our interest keep changing with our growing, you can not absolutely tell what you want to be in the future. For instance, colleage student decide their major when they are in junior year. It shows that they are still searaching the best subject suitable for them. Therefore, we can not be controlled by the plan which made by an immature mind in young age. So, I disagree the statement.

All in all, from what we have dicussed above, we can tell
that, our life keep changing with our growing.  Therefore, we can not been fixed by a predefined plan.
we should obtain much experience in our growing rather than just in young age; and pave a good road for the future.
