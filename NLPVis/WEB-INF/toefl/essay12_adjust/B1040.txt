I can not agree that the best way of ensuring a good future is planning while you are young. Actually it is good strategy if you can decide your future early and have plenty of time to plan and prepare. However, not every succeed people decided their future while they were young and nor early future decided people always succeed. There are also some advantages if you decide and plan your  future when you are not young

The first advantage of when you decide your future when you are not young is your thinking is wider and deeper than when you are older. People learn and experience while aging. Those experiences make people think more deeper and wider about same subject. For exmaple, when I was young I thought that Russian is bad country and America was good country. However, when I grew up I understood that there are many perspective. For this reason, aging can give you wider and deeper thought and it helps you to make a better decision.

Another advantage of when you decide your future when you are not young is that you can find which is your best or prefered way. When you were young, your experiences must be shorter than when you were old. Experiences can give you enormous benefit to find your way. For example, if you had talent of playing piano, but if you did not ever played piano, you will never know about your ability and probability. Choosing your future when you are young can cause removal of your probability. Doing work what you like is not only about success but happiness. Therefore, deciding your future when you are not young could make better decition to his abilities and happiness.

As conclusion, planning your future while you are young is not always good way. Because of advantages of aging such as wider and deeper thinking and more experiences, sometimes planning your future when is not young is another way to success.
