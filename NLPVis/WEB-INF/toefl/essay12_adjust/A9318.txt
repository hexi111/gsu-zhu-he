Some argue that people put too much emphasis on their personal appearance and fashion nowadays. However, I think putting focus on personal appearance is important for the following reasons.

First of all, research has shown the power of first impression. When people meet for the first time, they judge one another by the most obvious feature, personal appearances. Once the first impression is formed, it is unlikely to change. Therefore, it is important to give others the best first impression with personal appearances.

Secondly, making sure one's personal appearance is great shows respect and care to others. A true gentleman or lady always makes sure that people surrounding him or her are feeling comfortable. Certainly, none would feel comfortable around a person who wears weird dress or has oily and gross hair.

Finally, taking care one's personal appearance makes one feel more confident. We live in a highly competitive society. We need both capacity and confidence. When one is confident about oneself, he or she dare stand up, take responsibilities, and make personal breakthrough. Self-confidence makes an individual willing to confront challenges and gives an individual many opportunities to success.

Putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion is fine as long as it does not interrupt an individual's personal life and functioning. Given this condition, its good sides outweigh its bad sides.
