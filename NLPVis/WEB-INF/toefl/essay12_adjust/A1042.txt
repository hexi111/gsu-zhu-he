As we all known, chasing beauty is human's native character. Without doubt, personal appearance is important to our real life. However, when our life is richer and richer, it seems that people put too much emphasis on persanl appearance and fashion. From two sides, we can find the problem.

First of all, most people usually spend a lot of time on appearance. For example, when I was in university, I had a roomate who put too much emphasis on her appearance. Every morning, she takes two hours to make up herslef.  Indeed, we should wear clean and suitable clothes and make clean hair style before working, but I think it is not a good idea if we spend too much time on choosing clothes and changing hair style. 

Second, more and more companies emphasize the appearance of employees. When people are finding a job, the first thing they do is not to try their best to meet the requirements of companies, but to make themselves more beautiful and fashionable through very kind of way. Why people do like this? Because the companies put more emphasis on personal apperance and fashion than personal ability. 

In all, I think nowadays people spend too much time on personal appearance.
