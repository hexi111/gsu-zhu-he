Today's world, media has played an important role in human's daily lives.  Whatever are on the media, people will hear and see it and then trying to do the same thing as what they seen on T.V.  Because of this, I agree that nowadays people do put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, and I think celebrities also play a main influence to the younger people.

I can see that whenever there is a celebrity wearing certain kind of clothes or objects on them, many younger people would copy the style.  For example, if Britney Spear come out to the public putting on a big sun glasses, many young girls would go out to the stores and buy themselves the same kind of sun glasses that Britney was wearing.  The young people just want to be like the celebrities instead of being themselves.  

Not only that people want to copy celebrities' fashion, but they want to look "cool" in front of their friends.  No one wants to look stupid, everybody wants to have a great respect from their friends.  Many times, some people want to look clean and professional.  The society norm put many people in a situation where they do not want to look unclean when everybody is looking fashion.  No one wants to be left out.

Another important about personal appearance and fashion is that it is not just a culture practice, but a modern idea that high economic countries often practices.  For example, personal appearance and fashion was a practice that was first from the west, but many many high economic countries like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan are practicing this ideas.  

Overall, personal appearance and fashion is not just a western idea, but as people are getting rich or high financial, people begin to think of their personal appearance.  Also the celebrities are one main influence on younger people to look and dress like the celebrities.
