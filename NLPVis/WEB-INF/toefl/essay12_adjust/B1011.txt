I disagree with the above statement. There are lot of reasons behiend this, few are listed below.

Firstly when you are young, you have very less experience. You even don't know what are the available options for you. Because you did not see the  complete world yet. You know only what is around you. Therefore I believe without knowing available options, making a decision about your future is not a wise decision.

Secondly when you are young you get easily carried away with what you see around you. For example assume if there is a military camp near your house, you may deel like being a military officer, which may not be a right decision for your future. Young mind is very fluctuating so it is always better to make plans about your future when you are old enough and can make decision independently.

Thirdly the decision about your future mostly depends on your area of interest. And when you are young it is difficult to decide what you are interested in. As you go along, you reliaze what i am Interested in and what I am not interested in. So I would suggest to consider all options and choose your area of interest as your future plans.

Fourth reason behiend this decision is, when you are young, your decision will be mostly influnced by your parents/gaurdians. You will not be in a position to make decisions for yourself. Therefore I suggest to plan about your future when you are mature enough to take your own decisions.

To conclude I say that when you are young, you have very less experience, know about very less options available, are not very clear about your area of interest and you wont be mature enough to take decisions independently. Because of all these reasons I believe planning for your future when you are young is not a wise decision.
