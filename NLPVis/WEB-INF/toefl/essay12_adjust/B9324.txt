Having a plan is essential to the young's future. It is not only conducive to their study or career goal, but it also can explode one's talent in other area.

To me, I did not have any plan in my childhood. I just made my decision as it was time to choose. Therefore, I would lose the direction when meeting some tough choices. Sometimes, I even chose it without deeply consideration. As I grew up, I would miss a lot of good opportunities. For example, if I wanted to be a doctor, however, I did not study the related subjects in the young. Although you can study it now, I believe there is seldom to success without a consolidate foundation. 

Moreover, having a plan can reach one's potential in the future. If one has a music talent, he/she can develop his/her talent to reach the perk potential through learning some music instruments when they are young. When they are nurtured in the young, they may be become a successful or professional expert. It may also contribute their knowledge in a right way to the society, or even country. 

Besides, someone said that planning their future would never be too late if they have a heart to do it. However, I deeply believe it would waste plenty of time, and even they must have a large determination to do it. It is not easy way to everyone. However, time flies, people may not have opportunity to do it. Changes happpen every day no matter in people, environment and society. Is it available for people to follow their heart??? God knows.

I deeply believe people should plan their future carefully when they are young. It is a good way to develop their potential to reach the best.
