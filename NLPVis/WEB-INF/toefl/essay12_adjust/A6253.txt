People put much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion, but that is not a bad thing because having a good apperance shows respect to others and fashion is an art.

Good apperance is necessary in every situation, no matter what kind of environment you are in. Lawyers dress in suit before they go to court. Doctors dress in white lab coat before they go to hospital. Furthermore, some professions even require the necesary dressing.

Volunteering in the hospital is a good example. On the first day of orientation, it specifically tells me what the accpetable dress should be, "No jeans, no shorts, no earings", etc. It requires not only a neat and clean apperance, but it also asks for specific clothes. A good apperance is needed. It shows that ones cares about the profession he is in. 

A good apperance can bring convenience. People who dress sloppy and dirty will usually get pulled over by a police on the street though the policeman has no idea of who he is. Generally, people has their first impression on the apperance first, then they start to judge you base on talking with you and doing things with you. 

Fashion is also important. First, it is an art. Paris, France is a famous for its international fashion show. Thousands of people and fashion designers gather together to attend the show. And in school, art design is even a subject, a major that a student can earn a degree from it. It is important and it is worthwhile to pay much attention to it. It is a good thing that we appreciate fashion. I believe everything likes beautiful things. That's why fashion is popular.

One may say putting more focus on apperance and fashion  makes people neglect the importance of the inside, the interior personality. I don't think that's right. A good apperance is needed before someone is willing to come to you and start a conversation with you. He/she might not want to know you at the first place if you don't have a neat apperance.
