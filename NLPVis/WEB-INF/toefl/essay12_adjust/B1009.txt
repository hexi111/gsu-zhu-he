This essay proposes that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. I disagree with this statement. The reason is that there is no best answer for everything in the world esepically the things which relate to the future plan.

First of all, I will take the CEO of Dell for example. Dell did not know what he wanted to be in the future when he was a undergraduate student. He just hanged abround and helped people to combine the computer. At that time, he even got fail on most of his majors. However, in the end, Dell found something that he really wanted to do and started his own business. This is a good example of people do not need to plan carefully while they are still young.

Moreover, taking the Chinese parents for example. Chinese parents will help their children to plan the future career plan when they are young. The most improtant problem is that parents will not know what the children want. The career plan will base on what the parents want. As a result, many children will have some struggles with their parents if they do not like their parents' decisions.

To sum up, there is no best way for everything in the world espically the things that we can not expect. As a result, I disagree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. We can make the decision at every moment. It does not matter that we are old or young. Trying to find the things that we want to do is the way to ensure a good future for ourselves.
