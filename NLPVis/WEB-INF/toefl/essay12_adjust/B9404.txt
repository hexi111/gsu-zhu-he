Experiences from our parents and other historical successfully men and women have told us that making a long term plan while one is still young is crucial to one's future.  I would agree with it too if I was asked this question a decade ago. However, in the new century, I think this argument is out of date. 

Never before, we have so many opportunities in one's life time. The rapid developed technology, the fast growing economy, the universal access to education, and the globalization provide the endless opportunities to anyone who have dreams and work hard. You can go to college at any age of your adult life, and choose the any field you enjoy to learn and work as you want. Therefore, a early plan can only limit one's dream. When people are able to access to new information and learn new skill every minute in their life, lots of these who planed their future when they were young would one day realize that what they have been dreaming about may not be what they really want or what they really want the most. 

Life is a process of search and explore. When the ancient bonds such as the social class, the ethical discrimination, or the economy difficulties are eliminated in today's world, when every single one enjoy the equal rights to search and explore, and when the crazy thoughts only years ago became realities, why would we limit our dreams. Therefore, I believe that early plan of the future can only limit one's future and we have to let our thought free anytime in our lives.
