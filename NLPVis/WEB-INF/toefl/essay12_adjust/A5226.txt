I disagree with the statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

Apprearance and fashion are very ancient things. In the very begining of human society, people who are in high positions take care of their appearances very much because they need to make themselves look better than normal people. In my country, China, kings and empires used to put a lot of time on their appearances. 

Your appearance is a respect to the others. No one will like a people who always apprears in a mess. Good apprearance will let you keep in a nice figure then people will like to communicate with you and help you.

About fashion, as a man I can not say too much about it because I am not very familiar. But I believe most men like fashioned lady. Maybe many people will say that is waste to put too much emphasis on fashion. That depends on how you consider your life in my mind. If most things you care about are money and power, you need to catch up with fashion. If you just want to enjoy your life, you will be happy when you appreace prettier and more handsome and keep yourself in good mood.

So, apprearance and fashion are things people will chase forever. Sometimes they are even the motivation for people to work hard especially for ladies. If you don't work hard, you will not be able to afford to catch up with fashion.
