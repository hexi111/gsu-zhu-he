I strongly disagree with the statement above.  I actually believe that people do not put enough emphasis on personnal appearence and fashion. I think that the way one make his self look from the outside profoundly reflects what that person look on the inside, that is, I believe personnal appearance reflects personality. That is why I believe peolpe should emphasis on their appearance.

I also think that the more a person takes care of his or her appearance and the more that person cares about what people think about him or her, the more that person respect others.  This  means if you respect others, you have to take care of your appearance and look good for others, otherwise it would be disrespectful. Also, the fact of wanting to have good appearence in the eyes of others is also a sign of social integration willing.

I can take a recent French law as an example. That law prohibits people to wear signs that demonstrate their religious belonging in any public office. I believe that its a good thing for social integration, because the more you look like the people around you, the better you can integrate the society. That is espacially true for  muslim women who are not allowed to wear their head scarves to school anymore and who can look more like the rest of the french society where they have chosen to live
