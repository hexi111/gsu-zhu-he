i strongly agree with the idea. My future definitely depends upon my present planning and implementation. was not build in a single day.  we have many examples in the world which can justify this. a shue maker abraham lincoln become president of Amarica, a little girl from checoslovakia, generated hope of life for millions in the world, she is Mother Therissa. These all become possible only with carefull planning and serious implementatin.

Generally two persons influence your life, one way we can say that they can dictate our life. one is our parents, they wil teach us how to behave in the society. next person is a teacher, he will corect your bad deeds and he will teach you what is good. before 12 years of age, generally children used to accept what ever the parents or teachers says,  but after reaching the stage of adolisence they try to think weather that is good for him or not. this is very crutial stage in once life. here people should think and act perfectly then only future will be bright.

after reaching the age of 16, we should have a goal in life. life with out a goal is like ship with out a capten. the goal should be appropriate one. here one should take help from parents and teachers. after setting the goal he/she should be very sincire about that. some times you may get set backs, but we should not give up. as we have a proverb, Rome we Not Build in a signle day. it requires time. the seeds u plant now will give fruits tomorrow. 

it is possible that some times that we may choose a wrong track, then it is responcibulity of parents or teachers to put us in right track, a stich in time saves nine.
