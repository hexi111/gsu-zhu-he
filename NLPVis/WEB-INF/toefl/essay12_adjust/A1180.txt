the statement claims that people today simply put too much attention on personal apperance and fashion. based on what we can learn from school and our personal experience, I would agree with the arguer's claim. 

scholars claims that we are in a society satured with consumerism. it is a faily vaild claim when we consider the level of needs or erges  for things that we experience everyday. whenever there is a new gadget coming out, people want it. new cars, MP3 players, computers, cameras, you name it. everyday we are bombarded with countless ads from all sorts of media. 

news media and their ads not only tell us what to buy. they also show us what kind of people we should be, or at least whay we should look like. Media offers role models. and this funtion is so ubiquitously fulfilled that everday people never realize it. TV shows us what a fashionable young lady should wear, drive, eat or even who she should date--an attractive and assumably rich  young man of course. ads not only tell the lady what to buy, it, more often than not, teachs her how she should act, thet way she should walk and talk in order to attract a man. ads like this reinforce the social stereotype of women (sexual subject for men's pleasure) and men (for their roles to be rich and strong to attract women). 

therefore, even if people today are paying great attentions to their apperance and fashion (there is no denying of it), it is done more in a fearful way: the fear of one's ability to successful survive in the society and to produce offsprings. although this might be only one part of the reason. it perfectly demonstrates the kind of influence mass media could exert onto the society as a whole.
