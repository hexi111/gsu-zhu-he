 It is a ideal way to ensure a good future for oneself while one is still young, but unexpecting things happen all the time, one always need to adjust their plan and path to suit the certain circumstance.

  Take me as a example, I was a accountant back in China, my future will be certain and secure if I follow the path, but two years ago I got a chance to came to America, since then my life changed completely, my family and friend are not around anymore, I have to make decision all by myself, more important I need to re-plan my future, my career, and by now I'm not that young anymore. 

 We heard numerouse stories how people get the wrong path when they were young and back to the right track after they realised what are good for them, lots of people start their own business after they retired and living their " own life', it's never too late to make a plan to ensure a good future.
