Personal apperarance tells people who you are,  I totally agree the statement that people put too much emphasis on fahion, and there is no limit to be called "too much."
   
The first reason that I support the idea is becuase everyone wants to look good which is a human nature. unless people don't have enough time to put yourself stylish, it is simplly a desire to show your best to people. of coure, it all has to be based on no interrubts on your daily work and study. 

The second reason is that people tend to adjust people by the looks, so the fashion you put on is to tell people your charactors. for example, on a first meeting of a date, to show yourself as a fashionable person has more chances to get a good result than to give your date an image that you are unorganized and careless by dressing too caual.

Dressing fashionable doesn't mean fake, fashion is just part of you, try our best for our personal apperance doesn't mean that we don't need to improve ourselves inside. dressing stylish can motivate a person to develope themselves inside as beautiful as their looks. 

Inconclusion, today, everyone need to dress themselves to achieve a better resulut in his social life, because it is the time we are in.
