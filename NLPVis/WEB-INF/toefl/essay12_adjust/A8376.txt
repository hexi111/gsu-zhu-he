In my point of view to response the statement, I'll say people really put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion nowadays. We can easily find a lot of eviddences in our daily life.

First, while you turn on TV and watch a TV show, you can find out there are quite a lot of TV drama delivered havily concepts which emphasis personal appearance and fashion everyday. This shows, such as "American next toop model", "pussycat dolls" and so on, even though they are not directly emphasis the appearance and fashion is how importamt to people now a day, but what they valued in their show is just about those skindeep appearance of a person.

Second, if we pay some attention to the daily merchendise goods, while we compare two goods which are totally the same with each other, we can notice that the more fine the goods been packed, the more people are willing to pay for it. It tells us people concider much about the pretty apearance, it is so in conicdering about a person.

In conclusion, it is no doubt that people put too much emphasis on personal appearecne and fashion nowadays, we should do some moer effert in teaching them how to value a person by their inner beauty.
