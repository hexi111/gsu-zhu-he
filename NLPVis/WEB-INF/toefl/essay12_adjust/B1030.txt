In general, I agree with the statement that a good future is ensured with careful planning during youth. Although some adults feel that youth is the time when a person should experience only fun, careful planning may be a guarantee that successive stages of life will also be good.

Even though in youth we do not know all the many things adults experience, a general plan will help to make the future easier. For example, if a person has a plan, then obstacles in the future will be met with ease if he or she makes other alternative plans. For example, I initially wanted to be a medical examiner, but circumstances do not allow for such a plan. I have to look to other paths to achieve a good future.

Of course, there are problems with having a plan as well. No one can truly dictate how well plans will be executed. For example, what if a child came up with a certain plan but in adulthood discovered a new endeavor? Some will say that a well-thought plan will not encounter such problems, but the extent of the problem is much greater than a well-thought plan. This may be true because certain planning will void other plans for the future.

It is good to have a general plan to ensure a good future for yourself, but you have to make plans that will solve problems that may rise along the way.
