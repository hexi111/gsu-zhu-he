I disagree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. Although it is importatnt to plan my future in some abstract ways, i do not believe that it is good idea to decide detailed things for the furture to secure thier future. 

First of all, the definition of "good future" will be change while you grow up. when i was 18 years old, my good future is to make lots of money and get beautiful wife. But now i really do not care them. currently my good future is to make affordable money and have plenty of free time to enjoy my life. but there is possiblity that it also would be changed in the future. 

Second of all, when you are young, it is very important to be brave and challegable. If you plan about your future carefully, you would be more concerbative and cannot challenge risky things since they do not want to fail to their planned future. 

In sum, I believe that you do not have to plan your future carefully when you are young. Like Beatle's song "let it be", you can let yourself be more flexible. Life is unpredictable. Hense it is good to be flexible and try do your best to enjoy a current moment.
