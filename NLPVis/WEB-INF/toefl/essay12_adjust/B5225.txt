The quote "The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young" is considered almost as a common sense to people and I do agree with the idea. 

For most people, they spend the first 20 years of life in school to ensure a good future for themselves, because education helps you to learn things you need in life, in future career you would like to pursue later, and in social life. They learn these to make sure that they become the type of person companies would want to hire. Why do they do this? Because they want to have a good future that they need to get a decent job with a decent pay. If you want to let all this happen to you, you have to plan it for yourself at an early age, because you have to get educated to make this happen and those things need to be planned out carefully. Some people say that you can change your life when you are forty or older, but those are just a few cases with a tiny possibility, so I think you need to plan your life carefully while you are still young to have a good future.
