When I was young, I seldom spent time to think about my future. Many things are out of my control such as career, marriage, and studies. I never thought that I could come to the USA to study. It was in my plan when I was young. However, studying in the USA is out of my expectation. 
   
In additon, if people carefully plans their future, they cannot miss any detail in their timetables. No one can darely ensure that careflly plan can bring a good future. 
   
While some people believe that a bright future needs to be planned carefully. However, who calcuates the percentage of this? Many bachelor students do not know what they want to do after graduation because of the whole envrionment. For example, some bachelor students who study in the Teacher Education are not able to fulfill their dreams of becoming teachers. This market is too competative. Many people want  to have a stable job. But they are not to accomplish it since the acceptant number of teaching is very limited. Some of these studnets say that they planed carefully when they prepared for teaching certificate.
   
To sum up, carefully planning does not ensure a good future because of some unexpected factors. Therefore. people should predict expected and unexpexted factors in order to adjust their plans.
