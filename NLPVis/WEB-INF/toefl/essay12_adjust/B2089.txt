When asked about the best way to ensure a good future for yourself, I would agree that careful planification while one is young is the key to do so.

Planning is something we should all learn to do when little. By learning how to do it early in life, it becomes a habit, that will ensure success in other actitivies. There are a lot of factors that come in to play in when planning something, one of those factors are the unknowns. I believe that by learning to take the unknows into consideration you are able to react better to changes in life.

A second reason why planning ensures a good future is that even though planning doesn't ensure success, it gives the individual a map of where he is going, even though that map might change several times during the course of one's life.

When most kids are young, they want to be police men, fire men, cowboys, etc. those ideas eventually change, nevertheless the planning part does not change, it keeps going and as the person grows so does his plans. Therefore even though plans change, a person is able to adapt more easily to new plans, since they become used to the idea that plans can and do change.

Even though planning isn't everything when it comes to a good future, a lot of hard work is also required. Planning is a good habit and it gives the individual a map to follow in life, therefore we can conclude that planning carefully and acting on the plans will be the keys to a succesful future.
