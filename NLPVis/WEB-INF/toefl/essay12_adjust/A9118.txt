It is true that today poeple put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

In fact, today, people put a lot of attention in the external layer of their persona. They care in their appearance and in waht they wear. And, this, as  stated, is even right. It is right that people care about their appearance and in what they wear everyday. 

Yet, the problem is that people have crossed the line. In today world, it is more important to appear than to be. We feel sosial pression to be beauty and to buy expensive and "trendy" clothes. This pressure is not a suggestion but an imposition. We are not more free to decide waht body to have. We have to be thin. We have to have muscle and "big breast." We have to buy Dolge & Gabbana and Gucci, or Prada. This is "hidden" law that we have to conform. 

Appearance and Fashion are overstaed in our consumistic society. Everybody with " small part of brain left" should be able to recognize it. People should be evaluated for what they are and what they belief. Belief, values and costumes are the basic of every society. This sould be embodied in every book and in everyday small fragment of our life.
