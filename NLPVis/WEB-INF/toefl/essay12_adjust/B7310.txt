I disagree with the statement the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.  Many people say that you need to think carefully about your future, and decide what to do now, but is it always good to do something based on their future plan?  I would like to use Japanese example to explain some bad points about planning carefully while you are still young. 

In some private middle school and high school, students can choose subjects to study according to their future plans.  It is true that you can save a lot of time with this system because you don't have to study some subjects which doesn't seem very useful for your future plan.  However, you will miss a lot of possibilities by not studying some subjects.  You will change minds by studying certain subjects which doesn't seem important to learn for your future.

Then what should you do?  What is the best way to ensure a good future?  The answer is to try many things and learn from that experiences.  By doing this, you will find what is good for you or what you really want to do in the future.   

In conclusion, you need to have lots of possibility for the future.  Therefore it is more important to try and learn many things while you are young.  That's why I disagree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.
