Firt impression is usually based on a person's appearnce, and the impression determine make people predict other people's inner being. People even assess someone's ability by appearnce. However, appearance can not be evidence to evaluate people's ability or attitude.

This misunderstanding about personal appearance can undermine social effectiveness. For example, when the interviewer have a interview with applicants, if the interviewer appraise applicants' ability from their appearance, he or she can't find an appropriate person, which means appearance can't prove people's ability and even have negative effects on the society.
