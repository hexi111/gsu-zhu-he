Some individuals think to plan a good future for themselves when they were still young that is very help for having a good future.  However, others think that is just a imagination and it is no meaning for a good future.  In my opinion, although make a good plan for my future that seems like a fascinating idea, I think the plan is hard to come true, because everything is changing in every minute.

When we were still young, we did not have very mature thoughts about our lives.  Most of the dreams at that time are ridiculous.  It is very hard to make the dream of your childhood come true.   For example, I wanted to become a pilot when I was in kindergarten.  It seems like a good career for me in the future, but my eyesight are not very good.  It is the significant reason for me to become a pilot.  Therefore, the dream in someone's childhood that is just a dream.  It is no help for their future.

Everything is changing in every minute, so you do not know what will happen in the next second.  Such as a famous athlete of China, she won several gold medals for our country, and she plan to win more and more glory for ours.  However, during her training, her leg was broken. Hence, she can not attend any competition in the future.  To make a good plan is good, but it is hard to come true.

To obtain a good future, you should do everything as well as you can now rather than waste a lot of time on planing it.  There are too much reasons to effect your dream.  You can not control everything in the next, so do what you should do now.
