     I remembered my teacher said, "Never judge a person by his appearance." However, few people could do this, because first impression has great impact on how people think who we are. If we don't have time to get together or know each other, then we usually look someone according to our first impression. That's why more and more people try hard to be seen great and wonderful.
     
     Women's nature is to make themselves beautiful. The ways can be dressing nice clothes, wearing makeups, or change their appearance by "plastic surgery." Nowadays, not only women, men also start paying attention on their looks. Having handsome and beautiful faces, or dressing professional often give people good feelings. Sometimes when it comes to business, personal appearance determines if a case can be dealt or not. 
     
     For example, when I turn on TV or read newspaper, I usually search for the news about movie stars, sports players,  or singers. Great looks are somewhat key points for them to be popular. They always show up in any kinds of advertisements, to tell people what fashion is.  They usually have good looks, muscular or slim body shapes, or beautiful voices. These features make them famous, and normal people want to be like them. In fact, this dream is not easy to fulfill, so normal people would change themselves to look like famous people. They invest much money on changing appearance and chasing fashion.
    
     Putting emphasis on personal appearance and fashion also means we care other people's thoughts. If we don't care , we should we change? However, appropriate change is okay, but not over or extreme. After all, people would get old. If we invest too much money and time while we are young, we would have a miserable retired life.
