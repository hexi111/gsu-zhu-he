When we think about our future we should try to organize our ideas in a way that can help us know what we really want.  It is important to plan carefully but I don't think it is necesarry just while you are still young.  As a student you might have a lot of thing that you want to achive but also as the time pass by you might want to reach other things that were not plan, so is like you are going to be working on that all your life. 

It is important to think about different ways to ensure the best or at least a good future.  It is like a brainstorming, where a few alternatives could be completing a degree at the school you want or looking for a job that fills your expectations.  Think about how much money you will like to earn and how hard you have to work to achieve those expectations or goals.   

Planning your future is like a process of reflection where you try to analyze yourself and think about all the things that you will like to do.  It is the time to dream as high as possible since dreaming is the only way you will know how to get to those dreams.  For example; I always dreamed about studying in New York City and that requires I plan and organize all the things I need to complete before being able to move forward.

As a conclusion i can say that I do not agree with the prompt.  You have to plan your future not only while you are young, you must plan your future all the time to achieve any future goals
