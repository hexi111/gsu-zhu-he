I agree that people today put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I think that it is all because of the modernisation of the culture and the freedom given by the parents to their kids.

Today the younger generation is pretti much influenced by the movies and cinema. The kids try to act like their favorite actor or actress and want to copy them. They also try to copy the way of dressup like their favorite actor and actress do.

Their is also a competition among the friends and the classmates, they all try to compete with each other in terms of latest gadgets and devices, jewelery and other accesories. They all try to make their opposite sex attract towards them so they take much concern about their personal appearance and keep in touch with the latest fashion that prevails in the society.

But according to me one should always be simple and nice to others and then the world will follow behind you as whatever you are and whatever you look like.
