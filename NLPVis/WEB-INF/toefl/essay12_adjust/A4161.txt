I definitely agree that people nowadays are very concerned about their personal appearance and that being in fashion happens to be a sort of requirement for looking good. But people can not help doing so, because increasingly, every aspect of personal life requires a prompt appearance, from social relationships to the professional world.

Having a good appearance, and being in fashion, makes one socially desirable. Good personal appearance conveys attention to detail and being in fashion suggests affluence and style. These are among the main characteristics that the majority of people look for in a possible spouse.

Additionally, take a look at the professional world, specifically the workplace. During interviews, the interviewees would very likely stand a good chance of being hired if he or she appears professional and a candidate that the company feels would help with the image of the firm. Equally, appearance is what gives the first impression, and a well qualified candidate that does not dress for the occasion might very likely ruin his or her chances of being hired. Just with the topic of interviews alone, countless online websites have come into existence, offering tips and advise on how to dress well. 

Quite frankly, there is mounting pressure to look good in order to survive. One must take care of personal appearance in order to find as well as be considered as a possible candidate for relationships. Furthermore, a person needs to keep up a sharp appearance to obtain work.
