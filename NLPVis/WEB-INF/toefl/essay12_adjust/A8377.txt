I never come up with the idea of fashion before coming to New York City. One day, I saw many people look very very good when I was walking on the street in Soho, Mahattan. Suddeny, I had a question in my mind at that time. "Why people here are very good looking?" Then, I come up with the idea of fashion. There are many resons why now fashion is very important and why people have to care about their personal appearance. 

First, good appearance and fashion is a key for getting a friend. We have to meet many people every day because human being is a social creature. We have to do many activities in our life that connet with others- going shopping, talking with our friend, dinning outside and studing in the class room. For me, it should be better if we can keep a good relationship with others. One tool to make friend is physical language. If you have a good appearance and a well communication skill, you can make friend easily. Don't forget that people always judge other from outside appearance first before talking with him or her.

Second, fashion can make people happy because it is a design and style that make the world more beautiful. For example, colorful fashion make people feel relaxed and happy. This can affect to the society becuase fashion can leverage the level of humaninty and make a peaceful world.

In conclusion, I really believe that fashion is very important for people in the world because it is a tool for making a friend, and it also make peole feel happy.
