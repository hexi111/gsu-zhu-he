Appearance is a mirror of your personality.  Many people tend to care much about their appearance and fashion.  There are some arguments in this issue, but I am favor of this trend.

Appearance of a person is very important.  When you meet people for the first time, appearance and fashion play an important role in leaving impression.  You cannot ignore what people think about you besides your personality especially when you don't have any chances to get to know each other well.

For instance, I realize how appearance and fashion works better when I am in business.  I work in a student organization and work as a Vice President of Public Relations.  I dress nicely to wear suits and put on make up appropreately.  When you dress up in business, which makes a person more credible.  Fashion actually builds credibility.

Taking care about appearance and fashion is one way of expressing personality.  If you look good in nice fashion, you can build your confidence as well.  People don't dislike a person who dress nicely.  I also feel much more confident when I put on make up and wear nice fashionable clothes.  

Taking care about appearance and fashion costs money, but I believe it is a self-investment.  You can get return on spending money.  You can build your confidence, leave better impression to other people, and the most important thing is that you can get interested in yourself.  Interests in yourself is important because it is a good opportunity to learn yourself.  You can realize your personality better by learning your self.

Taking care about your own appearance and fashion works better in two ways in terms of leaving good expression to others and learning your personality.  I am favor of putting emphasis on appearane and fashion.
