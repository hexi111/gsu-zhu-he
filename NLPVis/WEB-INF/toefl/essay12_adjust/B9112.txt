Regarding to the above statement, I quite agree that it is very important for a person to plan for one's future caree as soon as possible. 

Looking back to the history, it is not difficult for us to find that   many heros have set up their life goas in their early life. For example, Chairman Mao, one of the greatest  revolutionary leaders, has set up his life goal that he would take the responsibility to lead the people to liberate themselves from their tribulations. As a strong willed leader, he persvered his struggling and devoted all his life in the great revolutiona event. Finally, he made it and became one of the greatest leaders in Chinese history.

Everyone is eager to be successful and many conditions constrain the possibility of the success. However, just like the old saying: eary birds catch worms. If a person is quite clear one's life goal and starts early, you might have more chance to succeed.
