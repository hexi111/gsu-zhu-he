Although there are some people who do not pay too much attention on what they will do and what kind of person they want to be in future, when they are still young; personally I really would like to encourage people to plan carefully while young to ensure themselves a good future.

Some people would argue that we do not know what will happen in future; and how do we plan our future in advance. Sounds reasonable, but in fact in my opinion, this is just an excuse for lazy individuals, who even do not want think about too much about their own future.  Of course, we could not predict anything in future. But If we could make a rough plan according to our ambition and personal goals, it would help us a lot to achieve big accomplishments. In this way, we could know clearly which aspect we need to put more energy and time to, consequently saving lots of time for us. Maybe the rough plan will change many times during our growth period. But in every step, we could know clearly what do we need to do and what kind of thing is most important for us.

Many persons often complain that they are confused about their future and they feel boring everyday. Why? Just because they lack the reason to make themselves excited and make their lives wonderful. In other word, they lack the plan for their own lives. If people have clear plans, they will try their best to complete such kind of plans, and even a small progress could make them very happy. Because they get their payment for their hard work.  In such way, they would work much harder to complete the next step of their plan, and finally ensure themselves a good future.

In sum, according to my experience and knowledge, I strongly suggest everyone to think carefully about their future and try their best to achieve their goal for good futures.
