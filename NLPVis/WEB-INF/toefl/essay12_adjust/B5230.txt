Most Asian kids are raised by receiving qualitity education. They learned a lot of things like English, the official language, Chinese, the most powerful language in Asia, many other instruments like violin, piano and many other sports which make one's body stronger since they enter elementary school. Learning many language, instruments and sports can be pressure to a little child, but as a long term, these can ensure a good future for a child.

First, learning language can be the most powerful ability for students. Actually, since most asian countries teach their national kids more than two language since they are young, there is a little bit of diffuculty that once Asian students go to western country to study more developed studies. Learning language since students are young makes the students study and work anywhere they want and Asian countries recall them when they are brilliant enough to take advantage. 

Second, since most Asian students learned a lot of good quality education since they are young, there is a little possibilities to fall into bad ways like abuse of drugs, alcohol. If teachers and parents are always looking at students, then students can realize that somebody is looking at them. Therefore, they cannot fall into bad ways to satisfy their teachers and parents.

For those reasons, since they get a good education since they are young, it is the best way to ensure a good future for theirselves to plan carefully.
