My life experiences has taught me to believe that in order to have a good future you must plan while you are still young. Through my education, I have learned this as well. I do not want my kids to work two jobs to support themselves because their parents don't have enough money to help them out. 

I have always been a planner. I was taught to be a planner by my parents and the message that I received was that by getting a good education, you can have a good future.  But in order to have a good education, you must plan for it. This is ironic due to the fact that my family didn't have a lot of money so there was no way to really plan or save for my education. 

As I grew up and saw the struggles my parents went through and have struggled myself financially, I started to learn that planning is really important, especially financial planning. Looking into the future is never a bad thing, I think. Of course, you can never plan for natural disasters, like floods, or your house burning down. However, you can make a decision to plan for the event or not plan for the event.

By seeing others struggle to live because they didn't plan their future at a young age made me evaluate my plans. I have seen my parents struggle, and my brother struggle with being the breadwinner and raising his children. 

Having financial security is a good thing, and then there's personal security. This includes having a stable family, children (if you want them), and being happy. The economics of happiness is not easy to define. I can only define happiness by stating that as long as you don't have huge, consistent growing problems as compared to others than you can be happy. 

As mentioned above, you can never plan for unexpected events, such as deaths in the family or natural disasters. However, you can make a decision on whether you want to have a buffer for the event.
