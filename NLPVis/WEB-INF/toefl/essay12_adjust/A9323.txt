I agree with that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. There are several reasons. 

First, the young people are easily affected by the TV shows.  The TV shows affect young people to care about the fashion.  Young people know many fashion style from the singers or movie stars, and they tend to become that kinds of pepole. Therefore, they engage in dressing fashion.  They want to draw other people' attention. 

Second, people tend to compare with other peopel. Nowadays,  people like to compare with other people.  Wearing good dresses can make them feel confidence.  People often judge a person who do not know by the dresses.  For the job interview, candidates should dress up to show their ability.  If a candidate did not dress well, he or she may lose a job.  Therefore, dressing well can show their confidence and get good impression from other people. 

Third, becasue the quality of life is good, people focus on seeking for good things to satisfy themselves. For example, they like to buy high level products, they shop at high level stores,and they eat at high level of restaurants.People want to get better life, so they care about fashion. 

The discussions which I describe above are the reasons that why people put too much emphasis on person appearance and fashion.
