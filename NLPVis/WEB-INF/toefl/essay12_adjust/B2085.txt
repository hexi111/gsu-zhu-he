Since you can talk other people, you have recieved the qustion that what will you do in the future. Why are people asking about the question? I think making a plan about their future in the young age is important to live in that they can know why they have to learn and find their own way to go their goal.

To come true our goal successfully, we have to learn from other people or materials. In general, we are going to school to learn something. But almost students don't like studying because they think it is not interesting and useless in their life. On the other hand, people who are good at their study know why they should study. The reason we have to study is learning is the way to come true our goal. If we have our own goal as soon as possible, we can enjoy our studying. Thus, the plan in young age is important to our left life.

Finding a goal is important because it decides life. Generally speaking, it is hard to find our really goal which means that we really want rather than big money or statue in our coummunity. To find really goal, we have to spend much time searching it. If we start the work from young age and we have experience to get the goal, it will be successful to find what we want. Hence it is important to start in the young children.

The goal makes our life good one or bad one. Therefore, it is important to find as soon as possible.
