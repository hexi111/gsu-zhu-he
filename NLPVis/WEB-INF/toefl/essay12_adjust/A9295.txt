I agree with the statement that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I grew up in the eighties when we were very content with an occasional dress sewn by a seamstress. Buying brand new clothes was a real treat for us and because we had very limited amount of television we cared less about fashion. Now I look at my little sister who was born a decade and half after me and all she seems to think about is what she will wear and how she looks. Sewing a dress at the seamstress is a big taboo for her. I attribute this to the availablity of so much television and films from the western world which has exposed kids of her generation to too much fashion.

The internet is another reason why people now put so much emphasis on fashion. Back in the days, we had no access to the worldwide web, we had no idea what was going on in the western world when it came to fashion so we were content with what we had. Now people of the younger generations have the means of surfing the internet at any time and this exposes them to the latest fashions and lives of celebrities which they want to copy.

I think young children these days have been exposed to so much television and other computer based programs that they are not as focussed on studying as we were when we were younger. They rather want to look good at the expense of studying. Advertising and the fashion industry have together won the hearts of most people who want to look exactly like the fashion models  do. People would sacrifice money for food and other necessities just to get the latest piece of fashion clothing or accessories.  

In this generation children also have so much access to money of their own or credit cards which they use to acquire the latest fashion pieces as dictated by the fashion world.
In the past that was not the case, money was hard to come buy easily and you had to make do with whatever your parents gave you.
