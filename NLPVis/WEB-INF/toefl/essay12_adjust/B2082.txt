The Good Future

What would be my future life? Is it good of bad? Everybody somehow comes up with such questions. We can not be ablsolutely sure that our future will be bright. I agree with statement "The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young" because it describes our nowaday life. When you plan your future you feel safe and confidence, without any hesitation. 

People after their graduation comes up with the question "What major I will be studying in the university?". And I know from my experinec that it is not an easy question to answer. There are plenty of jobs, but usually people find themselves best only in one field. Some are lucky with their jobs, but  some find that they are in the wrong and they want another things to do. So, in order not having such problems think ahead. Do things you like most of all, and even you will be old, you will do your work with satisfaction. 

Another aspect of future life is of course famile. As a member of society you will build your own family, will have children, and will rise them to be good. But there a lot of aspects concerning the family. When to get marruied? What characteristics and features of a future wife are the most important? What age would be the best to marry? And such question must be thought about very early. 

Our future is very important. Because you will be old, and sometimes have no opportunity to solve some difficult problems because of the age, it is a good idea to prevent youself from such problems. Make things when you are young in order to live without problems. And the best way of doing it is planning out your life correctly.
