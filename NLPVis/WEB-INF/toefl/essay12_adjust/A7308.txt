I agree with the statement that people put too much emphasis on personal aooearance and fasion. Nowadays we can see a huge amounts of appearance is selled all the place. People love to wear famous brand, love to show off, which are totally wrong. 

When i went shopping, I saw some of the cloth are really expansive, and people still buy them without a second thought, since the brand is really famous. In my opinion, that just doesn't worth. I just don't understand what is the point for alway wearing expensive cloth, it always confuse me.Moreover, I have no idea why people could wear jeans, pants during the summer. Aren't they hot? and what is the purpose for the shorts? What make them wearing the jeans during the summer? I think the only reason is that wearing jeans can make them looks batter, and that is the only reason I can tell. 

Sometime we can see from the news that a company have a limited amount of ilems, and people are just being crazy in order to have one. However, they are all in businessmen's trick. Businessmen purchased some limited ilem in order to make the price higher and higher. And there is always somebody would like to pay for it no matter how expensive it actually is. 

On the other hand, people regard other if they can have good appearences. They do not care about people's mind. If somebody is really kind, but she/he does not have good appearances, then sometimes she/he is always been ignored. The way people see other have been changed. We care about how others' outside is, but we forget that the most important stuff to evaluate a person is the true heart. 

Nowadays, people put too much focus on the personal appearance and fashion. And that causes not only people spending luge amount of money just because the famous brand, but also change the way how we evluate others.
