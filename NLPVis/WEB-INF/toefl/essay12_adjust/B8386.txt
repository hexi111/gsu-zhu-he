Making plan is important. The life is only one time and we can't repeat that even though we made mistake. However, I don't think that the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully while you are still young. I disagree this statement.

The life is interestiong, because we don't know what is going to happen at the next moment. The life is like this. Everybody has a dream or a target especially when he or she is young. However, in many case, it will be changed.

For example, somebody wanted to be sports player and his parents made a plan but he didn't have a talent, then he became business man and got success. If he continue to try, he might not get success.

Sometime, if the people make a plan, they are very afraid to leave or change from the original plan. It might be the cause of losing some chance. The poeple must be flexible for everything.

The most important thinga are to have a ability to survive when you face the problem, to get the chance when you face the chance and to make a right decision when you have to choose something. They help people to have the good future.
