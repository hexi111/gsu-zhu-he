I do not agree with the following statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. In my opionion, we should emphasize on personal appearance.

First, personal appearance indicates one's own stytle. Everyone is a different individual. He or she should be different. People with the same sense of fashion can be good friends.

Second, different jobs need different appearance. When you are at home, you may need not care about your appearance. But in public, you should 
care about your own appearance, which sometimes is a way of respecting others. Furthermore, some jobs , such as waiters, need the emphasis on 
personal appearance. It will be better for a waiter to be clean and smiling.

Third, I think personal appearance and fashion can give people self confidence. Girls will be more confident when they appear to be very beautiful. Finally, the fashion industry creats a lot of jobs and wealth for our 
society.

Therefore, I think we need to emphasis our personal appearance, but  we need a banlance.
