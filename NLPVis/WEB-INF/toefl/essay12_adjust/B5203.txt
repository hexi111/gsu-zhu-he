Planning is what we have to do for a good future. I completely agree with this statement because a person with no plan does not know what to do.

While we are young we have to think for the future. The future is bright when planned with thoughts and research. With out a plan is like writing an essay with out and outline. that way you start talking about one thing and the next moment you are talking about another. which makes people complicated in doing what they want to do. People will get lost and they won't know how to start on whatever they want to do.

While we are young is a good time to start because as wehave a lot of time in our lives we can still carry on our plans and make mistakes. Through these mistakes we can make changes to what went wrong.

This is why it is good to make plans when we are young.

To look back in the past and the mistakes we make then correcting the mistakes will be a lot better than making a mistake of your life and having no chance to revive that mistake.
