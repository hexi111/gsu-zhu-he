I agree that planning the future carefully when one is young may ensure a good future.
      
Plan of future when one is young may help set a great goal.   A great goal can benefit one growing mentally healthy, because he or she may know what kind of person he or she will be and how to be. The one may avoid drink or drag problem. For example, if a boy intend to be a medical doctor when he grow up, he may study hard and avoid drink or drag. Even he do not be a medical doctor in the future, the childhood goal can help him grow up healthy.
      
Planning future may help one success. For instance, if a girl set her goal to be a professor in the future, she may devote her time and engery to study not only her subject but also educational skill and knowledge. With this skill and knowledge cumulated for 10 years, she may be much easier to achieve a academic success and to be a professor than the one set his of her goal late.
      
On the other hand, when one is young, he or she may not know what kind of goal he or she intend to achieve or how hard to he or she strive to achieve. Or when one grow up he find the  plan   he or she set is young.
