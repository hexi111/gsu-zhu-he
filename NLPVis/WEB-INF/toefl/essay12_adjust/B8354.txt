Some people say that the best way to ensure a good future for themselves is to plan carefully while they are still young. I stongly agree because that is advantageous in many ways.

First, young people have more chances to think about their future. They do not need to limit their dreams and plans from family responsibility and many other expectations. Thus, they can experience what they want to do in the future and pick one of them which he or she likes.
