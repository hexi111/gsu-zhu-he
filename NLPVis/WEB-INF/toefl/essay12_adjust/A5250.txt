I remerber one of my friend told me that her daughter, three-year-old, rejected to go school because her mother didn't permit her wear her favorite skirt.  From this little girls behavior, we can know that people are putting more and more attention on personal appearance and fashion. But I think it is too much emphasis on them.

Firstly, the percent of salary is used to buy clothes and such kind of stuff  is higher than before, furthermore, more and more woman are spending their time on shopping. All this trend shows us that our lives are better than before, but sometimes people put much more on. Every day the offic ladies spend more than thirty minutes on making up. The "white collar" consume most of spare time to shop suit. All these tell us people put too much emphasis on them.

Secondly, everyone like beauty. A good appearance can give people a good impression. Nowdays, every year people love to select American beauty, American Miss, or World Miss. When you watch these programm, you will find the passion of people is not less than that of watching football match.  It fully supports that people put  too much on it. I don't mean it is not good, but it is not a good phenomenon to our social because it is too superficial.  

At last, it will effect the people's conception. Once more and more people chase fashion, we will forget what is really important. You can see so many people will pay attention to their appearance and fahion before interivew, on the contary, forget to parpare for the questions they will be asked. They go shopping, make hair, and spend most of money to let themselves look beautiful and acctracted. However, once you let them to buy some books to broaden their knowledge, they will feel you are out of date.

So, in summary, I think people put too mch emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
