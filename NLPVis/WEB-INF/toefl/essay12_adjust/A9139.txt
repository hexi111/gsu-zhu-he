Importance of Appearance

In commenting on the statement "nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion", I would say that I agree to some extent. In a world of business and commercial, people are more and more dominated by the market that prescribes the latest fashion. Looking at some people at my University, one would notice that many students put a lot of effort into their appearance, may it be make-up, clothes, or extra-ordinary accessories. It seems as if their appearance to others is of paramount importance to them, more than demonstrating their inner values, education, or individual character strengths. But aren't these the things that truly distinguish people from each other? Do we chose our friends because they "look good", or do we like them due to their warm, sincere personality? 

Of course, the appearance of people may be important, and it’s usually nice if someone looks taken care of; yet, I feel that appearance and fashion are over-evaluated by the younger generations in our society. At various occasions, I have witnessed that the appearance of people on TV shows, news or magazine pictures is all that is commented on with phrases such as "look how skinny", "what an awful dress" or "what did she do with her hair". The trend is to judge people by their appearance more than their inner values, a trend that growths with time. While personal appearance and fashion will always be important to us (due to the nature of human beings in the 20th century), we need to pay attention that these values are not taking over our lives. I feel that inner values are less and less taken into consideration when judging other people. In my view, appearance and fashion are not important to me, and the reader of this essay may notice that with regard to the difficulties I have even writing about such a trivial topic.
