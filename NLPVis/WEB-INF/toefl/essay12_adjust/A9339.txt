Nowadays with the income increasing,fashion shows and expensive clothes are on ,some people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I am against this kind of behavior or idea.

There are several reasons why I don't like this idea.Firstly, I never think appearance matters so much that we need to put so much time to take care of that. from my point of view ,I prefer knowledge to appearance since knowledge is power.

Secondly,fashions take money and energy.Especially there still are some people in this world are hungry and poor,they are struggling to survive,we should not waste money to do fashions. 

Thirdly, fashion will sooner or later disappear with time going on, why not keep our effort to pursue something else that can contribute to the society for long good like music and book writing? 

All in all,I really don't  like the idea of put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.From the reasons above,I prefer put less on appearance and put more on knowledge or other useful careers.
