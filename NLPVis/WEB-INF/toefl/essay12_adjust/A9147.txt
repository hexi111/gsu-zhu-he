In today's world, people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. I think the changing world or the fact of globalization push people to be in such a way. In this short essay, I will discuss this emphasis on appearance with regard to the consumption society.

In the capitalist system, people consume more and the more they consume, the more they need. Then, the consumption has been increasing. Of course, the capitalist world needs more consumption as creating new markets. The advertisement is one of the tools that this sytem has been using to increase the consumption. In this sense, people, as seeing models in ads or in the pages of magazines, feel to be like them and give more emphasis on the beauty. Especially, the young generation follow what is new in order to have a better appearance. They read magazines and go to the malls regularly to be like the models they see in the media or like their friends. 

Actually, emphasing fashion could be considered as a way to be social or to communicate with people. Since, we could not disregard the fact that people are evaluated firstly according to their apperance. For example, when I apply for an internship or a job, I pay attention to what I wear and how I look like. Then, emphasis on appearnce is required in today's society to be acceptable.

In sum, having considering the capitalist system and the factor of socialization, it is likely to be argued that people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. This situation have been normalizing and presenting as an important part of human life. Is it not the thing that we should question and challenge its acceptance in the society?
