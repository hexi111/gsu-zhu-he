"Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion."

I semi-agree and semi-disagree with the above statement.

In Europe, there is a lot of emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, especially in such Western European countries as Italy, France, or England. Society could be very judgemental in a way that they criticise people based on their look. Women in Europe are very much concerned with their clothing, make up, or anything else that has to do with appearance and not the personal qualities. Men are too, indeed.

In my opinion, in the United States, there is almost no emphasis  on personal appearance and fashion, with the exception of society in big cities, such as New York City or Los Angeles. People in the United States seem to care more about personality of a person, and not their look. At the same time, I agree that my opinion could be bias, because I am European. United States people could be very judgemental in the eyes of their own society. Although, in contrast to Europe, it seems to me that there is not such issue in the United States.
