The answer to this question totally depends on the different situation.

In some circumstance, you should pay attention to your appearance. However, in other circumstance, you should not spend too much time in decorating yourself.

For example: 

    If you have received a job interview, you have to take some time to prepare your suit. Because a well-dress person will give interviewers good impression even right before any real interviewing procedure. On the other hand, if you do good preparation for your appearance, you explicitly show that you really care about this position and have confidence to get it.

    However, this is a different story in other circumstance.

For instance:

    If you work in a IT group that has casual style, you should make you be one of its member rather than make you look like a alien. In other words,  you should dress in the similar style as your colleagues. If you dress too formerly, your workmates will look at you differently.

    So the conclusion is that you should take care of your appearance smartly and adapt to the environment where you work at or study in. The baseline is that the time spent on dress should not interfere with your real work otherwise your focus is not appropriate and should be adjusted accordingly.
