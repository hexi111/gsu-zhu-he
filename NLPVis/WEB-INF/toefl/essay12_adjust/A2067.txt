It goes without saying that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashionin nowadays.  There are more and more television shows and programs designed for teaching peple how to ware and dress and put fashion make-up on their face.  As far as I'm concerned , it is because that the mass media shape this social trend and reinforce the idea of emphasizing appearance and fashion.  For example, in the Hollywood movies, there is no bad-looking male and female in the movies.  The main characters in the movie always have hansom or beautiful appearances, even the bad guy own a good-looking face.  This effect can gives people an illusion that in the real world, people always looks good and fashion.  There are another evidence that the MTV program provides people an opportunity for people who don't satisify their appearence to change their face by placitic surgery.  This show not only advocate the importance of appearence but encourage people having placitic surgery to become what they want.  Therefore, I totally agree the idea that people now put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
