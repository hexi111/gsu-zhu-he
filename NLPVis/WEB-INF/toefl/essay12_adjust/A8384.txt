Now, many people focus on how their appearance is looking good and what is latest fashion.  Many plastic surgeoy hospital and fashion store open it because of this. Therefore, I think people should emphasis on their personality when they put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fasion.   It is not depending on our appearance when we work;  we may spend plenty of money on fashion if we focus on fashion much.

First of all, when we work in a company, i should have the ability to work very well but not we have a good-looking we can do it better. Although, many companies they emphasis employees' appearance they they go to interview,  they also focus on how employees can work very well. 

Besides, most teenagers love to go shopping and buy a lots of fashion books but they just get money from their parents.  therefore, they spend plenty of money and time on fashion, so they may give their parants a big loads, they do not do many things they should do.

In conclusion, I disagree that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
