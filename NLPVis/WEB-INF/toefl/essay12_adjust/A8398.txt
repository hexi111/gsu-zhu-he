I think there are two reasons why people emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  I will explain as below. 

Firstly, some people think we understand their charactor and personality thruogh  and fashion.  For example, if some one wear expensive 
cloth and have a expensive brand bag like Louis Vitton, 
what do people usually think?  We tend to imagine the person would have own policy and the person wants to be seen how rich he/she is.  Fashion directly shows our personality.

Secondly, many people believe if we have a good apeearance, we have a lot of advantages. That is true. 
When I was a child, I am bit chubby and big compared with other classmates. Some of my classmates made fun of me and bullied me because of that reasons and I had been having a difficult time through my apperance. When I was age 20, I succeeded to go on a diet and got a slim body. Obviously, my appearance had looked better than before when I was a child. As a result of the diet, many men suddenly try to treat me nicely and I experienced a lot of advantage as a woman through my apperance.  I was so surprised at the attitudes people had done for me and I really hate that peple judge us it's just because of their apperance. However, it is the reality of our life. 

To sum up the two idea above, I do agree with the idea people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion nowadays.
