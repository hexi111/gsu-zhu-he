I agree with this point.
 
I have two reasons to support my point.

First, lots of great people in history who were thought had done things unbeliifble had a dream when they wew still very young. And they insist that their whole life time. Like lots of scintists.

Second,that might not just by chance to be like that. Because if you plan early, you will know what you need to work on and notice on them, you don't need to waste your time, because life is short for great heart.
