Generally speaking, I totally agree that a lot of bright future of ourselves are initiated by our planning when we are young. However, such kind of planning is just one of numerous key issues affecting out futures.

There is an old saying that things always change ahead of your plan. Even though it is good to have a long-line plan since we are kids, later on we would find ourselves extremely hard to follow the initial plan. What's more, we may realize how naive those plans are. Therefore, it is almost impossible for us to have a perfect plan before we learn, before we know this world, in particulaer, before we know ourselves.

In my opinion, the best way to have ourselves a good future is to always keep learning. Having faith in ourselves, keep learning everything we see and tweak the plan we always have in our mind since we are young. In all, there is no universal best ways for all. There is only the one suits yourself, which leads you to a good future.
