I believe that the best way to ensure a good future for  yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.

There is an analogy that I really like. It says that getting a college education is just like driving. If you know from the start where you are headed, then you will get there faster. No one would like to be stuck with a career that they absolutely hate for the rest of their lives. Exploration into various career choices allows a person to learn more about themselves and what they are passionate about. The faster someone decides what they want to do, the faster they will achieve their goals. 

I have had my first year of exploring different subjects that may be of interest to me. Since this is my second undergraduate year, I feel that it is absolutely necessary to already decide what my major course of study is going to be. By creating a timeframe for when I would like to meet my educational goal, I have more motivation and focus on the course work that is directly related to my major. My career goal is to be a successful professional in my field by the time I turn 30.  In my potential career industry, the supply seems to be exceeding the demand. Therefore, by graduating early, I will have sufficient time to participte in internships to gain work experiences, and from then on hopefully work my way up to my desired position.
