Nowadays, lots of people like to pay many attention on their apearance or fashion. Some people think that they had put too much emphasis for it, and that is what I think so. I think they had put too much energe on the things that are not that important.

In my openion, if you put too much energe on your appearance, you will also judged other people with the same way as yourself. In this way, you can only see other people's outside but not inside.

In the other hand, some people had pay too much attention that they forget what is the right thing to do. For example, some student would forget to do their study and just worry about how to improve their look. Or pay attention on their part-time job because they want to earn money to buy fashion products. It is not the right thing for a student to do during their school life.

In a word, I think it is not necessary to pay too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. The best way to showoff is to be yourself.
