I agree that statement that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.

First, when the children in the childhood, they still have plenty time to make the future plan.  Although the children do not have much their own opinion to think about  their future life, they have the ability to make the plan and eager to make the plan.  If they want to change any plan of their future, they can easily  change that and start the new thing again.  For example, a boy who is in the middle school now and plans to go the a university to learn the business.  However, after he graduated from the high school, he find he loves the engineering.  As a youngster, he can change his mind and achieve his goal immediately.  

Second, the old can't accept the new things quickly and it is not practicable for the old.  This rule is known to the world that the old people's memories are not as good as children's.  The old people want to change the plan, they need the time to achieve it.  We can imagine that if an old man already has a happiness family and has the grandchildren.  He wants to make a future plan which is change his part time job.   While, an old man wants to change his job is not a easier thing to him.  Because he already familiar with his work, if he change the job, he will learn the new knowledge again and after a while he can apply it to the work.

Third, their parents can help children to make the property plan.  Children have their parents to help them.  They all have good experience in the life time.  And can give children suggestion about the plan.  But, the old only have their children who don't have much experience of life.  Maybe they can not help them.

All in all, I think the best time period for people to make a good future plan is when people still young.  It is obey the natural  rule and best for the grown of those youngster or teenager.
