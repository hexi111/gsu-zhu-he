Nowadays the commecial advertisment is much deeper into our everyday lives. Some people may think we should put many enery in our appearance. However, some may think outside fashion is not as important as my ability, we should not put too much emphasis on it.
for my opion, fashion is important especially at fist sight, but abilities is the only method to help us face the challenges. 

There are a lot of reasons which can prove that we should not put too much emphasis on our apperance. The most important reason is that everyone only has 24 hours a day, we can not get extra time and enery to spend. And we can not focus on all the items we are doing everyday. It means we can only put our emphasis on some of them, and have to give up the rest. To improve ourselves , I think we should focus more on our family lives,  professional fields and our careers.  Usually clean and smile is best appearence for us. it is hard to image a scientist can read the fashion magzine everyday and still can win the nobel prize. Usually a formal suit is enough for scientists. when we do some prezentation, all the audients only cares about the content of presentation.

Of course, here I am not saying the appearence is not important. especially for the people who is fashion designer. They should put all of their energy on the fashion and appearance because of their careers. Also it is not a reason to be an unorganized person. We also should make us clean to face other people. it is a respectation to others.

Form the above discussion, we may clearly draw the conclusion that appearance and fashion should not occupy a lot of time and energy in our daily lives. To some extent, we can just take it as an entertainment.
