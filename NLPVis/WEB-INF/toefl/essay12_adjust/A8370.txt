Personal appearance have defiently been encreased through the years. Many people especially women are paying more attention to their looks. Personally I see it as a positive event. Without passing on obsession, we all should be concerned about our appearance.

To pay attention to your appearance it means to take care of your self. Most of us have a busy life and that is what makes us forget to do some necessary things in our everyday life. Going full time to school, having a family ,working and leaving in a busy city fills us with stress and makes us look awful. Trying to look good can make us feel better.

There are times when taking care of your self becomes an obsession, which can be wrong. There are so many women that over react about their appearance.These persons live behind issues that are very important in life just to look pretty. They spend a quantity amount of time in beauty saloons, while they can spend this time in more significant persons and aspects. 

In the same time following the fashion can be a way to make you feel better, but in the same time can make you to overspend money. Dressing yourself with fashion is a positive thing when you know how to manage it right. But, some times is hard to balance the obsession of looking good and the fact if fashion is affordable to you. Many people end up on serious problem because they spend a lot of money on fashion, which at the end it is not an determinative factor for a better life.
