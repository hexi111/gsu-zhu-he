Elder people often advise that we need to plan our life very carefully and it will help you make your future better. Since the advice comes from their experience, I'd like to respect it. However, I believe that there are different plans for every different stages of life. 

When I was an elementary school student, I wanted to be a lawyer. The job looked really good because I could help people's difficulty at the court. Of course, my parents were happy with my plan. Things had changed when I got into the middle school. I could find more interesting topics in sciences and mathematics. Those topics excited me a lot since they provided a lot of sophisticated methods to explain our world. When I was an elementary student I couldn't meet those kinds of topics. After I chose electrical engineering as my major, I could try my best to get into the best university in my country because there was a concrete objective. However, it might be impossible that I could find my interesting topics when I was 10 years old. 

I could also imagine the similar circumstance. When I was an undergraduate, I couldn't choose any one of topics electrical engineering covers since they are sometimes very similar and sometimes totally different. Since they look similar one can find their difference only after they totally understand the underlying ideas. When I was senior, I could figure out difference between "control", "device physics", "circuit theory", and "communication theory" and could choose "control" as my field of study. 

I believe that if ones can find their future plan earlier, they may put their energy on their topics of interest. However, I'd like to say that we can make a different plan for a different stage of life. And the examples explains why we should make a right decision only after they got to know about it. Therefore, although it's good to make a plan when we are young, but we don't have to be in hurry.
