For this statement, I agree some part of it and disagree some other part. We all know the importance to plan everything well before doing something, for example, students should plan their studying schedule earlier before they have exams; businessmen should plan their meetings and projects in order to maintain their companies. If we plan everything carefully, then we won't feel anxious nor frustrated when we encounter  difficulties in our lives. We will know what to do and organize everything. So we can set up career goals, dream future, what we want to possess in the future, in order to plan other details to make sure that every step we take is on the right track.

However, is everything can be planned earlier?Can we be whatever we want to be when we were young? Besides dreaming and only planing whatever we want, we still need to compare our reality and ability with our hopes. When we are young, we have lots of time to try out, but it is important to be realistic and rational when we want to make plans for ourselves. Only dreaming and planing is not enough, we have to start the very first step to realize it and fulfill our dreams. If we know our abilities and reality well, then we plan our future, that would be much more doable and then leads to a prosperous future. 

It is true that we should plan for our future early while we still young, but we need to face the truth and do some practical plans for ourselves. Set up some doable and practical goals are really important for young people, and what is more important is to realize it. After all, no one knows what is the definition about "good future" to you, only me myself can design my future and start to step out my first try.
