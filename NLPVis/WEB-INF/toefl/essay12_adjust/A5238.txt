Some people think nowdaus people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion but others do not think so. In my point of view, I think people do put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. 

It can not be denied that personal appearance and fashion is becoming more and more important in our daily life. With the developments of our society, people can earn more and more money. People want to have a better life. They think that they can also be a star. People want to wear the same clothes as the famous people's. They think this can make them more popular and fashion. According to a study in China, about 24% students in China put more than 4000 RMB on clothes per year even though they do not have a job and about 10% of the students put over 10000 RMB on their clothes. With the developments of science, people can even change their appearance. A friend of mine told me that he was not satisfied with his appearance and he would go to the hospital to change his appearance in the future. I do not agree with him.  I suppose that everyone is unique because our appearances are given by our parents. We can change our clothes but we can not change our appearance. Some people think a film star is hot then they change their appearance according to his or her appearance. Is that good? Can that make them beautiful? I do not think so.

People want to be cool and attractive so they buy a lot of clothes. Sometimes that will lead to a waste of money. For example,students also want to be cool so they ask their parents to buy them a lot of new clothes. If the clothes are out of date, they will never wear them again even the clothes are totaly new. Sometimes some girls want to be beautiful so they wear mini skirt even when the temprature is below 0. They probably know that it is bad for their health but they still do that just because they want to be attractive.   

All in all, i think people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
