 I agree with that people put too much emphasis on oersonal appearance because we can see a lot of advertisements and programs that teach people how to dress and persuate people to buy all kinds of decoration for their appearance.

     Watching television becomes the main leisure activiy in the modern society. Pulic communication has the power to affect people's lives. When we turn on the TV, 80% of the time advertisements are on. We acquire common knowledge and news from TV programs and most of us believe what they learned from them. That means if the programs tell people what they should wear and eat, peolpe will follow the direction and feel that they themselves have real life and are fashion.

     Fashion, however, does not mean a meaningful life. We often learn that many celebrities live a fancy and luxury life but they end up with hollow and sad inner spirit. They care too much about other people's feelings on them, and if they cannot get positive feedback from others they are disapointed.  Moreover, in some countries such Korean and Japan, women will not go out of their house without applying make-up on their faces. Even when they go out to the convinience store in 5 minutes distance, they dress like they are going to job interviews. 

     Putting too much emphasis on appearance wastes time and affect people's health, inner and outer. If we just clear appearance and use the spare time to get along with our family, we can have a meaningful life.
