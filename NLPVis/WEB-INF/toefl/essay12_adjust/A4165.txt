Its hard to agree or disagree that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I believe that its a choice of the individuals. Everyone loves to be recognized and enjoy stardom. Everyone wants to become celebraties, like Paris Hillton, Brad Pitt etc. One of the ways to get attention of people is through their personal appearance. Having said that there are lot people who get much attention by their hard work and innovation, for example Steve Jobs (Apple Inc), he doesn't put much emphasis on his personal appearance and fashion. Those were few big names who make their appearance on everyday newspaper. 

Now speaking of ordinary people whom we see in our everyday lives, for e.g, in offices, schools etc., I have observed that many young people (freshmen) want to be like their heros and dress up like them and be like them. This is probably due to the fact that every one has a desire to be famous and it depends on the individual that how they want to be noticed. I must agree that most of the youth put lot of emphasis on their appearance.
