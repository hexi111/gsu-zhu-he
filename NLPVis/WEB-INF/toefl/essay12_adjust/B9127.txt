The goal can be great motivation for a person, so people are affected by their own goal subliminarily. 

When people are young, they hardly decide to what to do in the future and have just a vague goal  because many young people don't know thier aptitudes or abilities. Inspite of their undecided future, if they don't plan their future, the possibily to reach their goal decrease due to lack of motives, so planning future may stimulate young people's ambition.

In addition, planning future make people save time. For example, when people travel abroad, if they don't have any plan or itinery, they might waste their time on the road and wandering around the same place. Therefore, people usually make a specfic plan for trip in oder to avoid wasting time. Like this, if young people don't have their destination in their future, they are likely to spent their time meaningless behaviors. 

In this view, young age is a good period to try useful activities for the future. For the future, young people can prepare their goal through many activities. Regardless of the success of activities, experience can promote them to reach their goal more easily or effectively.

Furthermore, there is a chance to change their goal more readily. From the experience of failure, they can make better plans for their future and be able to know what is the best way to accomplish their goal quickly.
