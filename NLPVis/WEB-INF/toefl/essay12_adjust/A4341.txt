The first impression frequently decides about our attitude towards the person, thus the appearance should be considered as a very important aspect of one's personality. 
People communicate their personality, temper, political affiliations, socioeconomical and proffessional status through conscious or subconscious selection of a given attire, hair style, make up and accessories. Certain proffessions require wearing special uniform or following a rigid dress code in order to emit the desired message to the environment. We also have certain expectations and build our opinion about a person based on their appearance. This is the reason why the politicians would need to be very conscientuous not only about the verbal message sent to their constituency, but also about the image they project through their appearance. A flabby personal trainer is less trustworthy and thus less employable than a fit, sporty looking one. Ans a celebrity film star is expected to look in a certain way. The visible tatoos, although perfectly acceptable by the society, are prohibited in certain professions. It's hard to imagine the Kindergarten teacher with unusual body adornments finding employment easily or a speech pathologist with a tongue stud successfully completing a job interview.
Of course the appearance shouldn't be the only criterium used in judging other people as it can be misleading. Some cultures attach more importance to the attire than others. As a European I'm used to more formal dress style than is accepted in the United States and the "bussiness causal" accepted there would not be appropriate for European office.  
We still, however, "dress up" in order to show our respect to the employee, the host, the elderly or the event. And even in we are aware of the fact that the appearance may be misleading, the research shows that the first impression, based solely on the observation of somebody's appearance, decides about our opinion about this individual.
