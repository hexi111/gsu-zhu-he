Everyone dreams to get a good future. The problem is how to turn the dream to a reality. Some people think that the best way is to plan carefully while you are young. Without doubt, careful plan is very improtant for a person's development. However, it can not work well based on several reasons. 

First of all, everyday is changing. China has an idom:"Plans never catch up changes." The plan we are making now is good today, however, maybe tomorrow it is not good for people. For example, In the middle of 1990th in China, computer was a hot field. So many parents wanted their children  to learn computer. However, four years later, just after these students graduate from univerity, IT entered into a low level, many companies laid off employees. So it is difficult for them to find a job, not refered to a good future. In all, plan carefully can not ensure a good future. 

Second, it is difficult for people to act according to their plan. Different people have different background. Usually, if people have rich family, they can do anything they want. But if people are poor, there are great limitations for their behavior. For these people, they just can dream. So they can not get a good future if they only rely on plan. 

Third, as far as I am concerned, in order to get a good future, the most important thing is to do our best today. 
No one know what will happen tomorrow. In most situation, we can not handle our life by ourselves. The only thing we can do is try our best to do today's job because good future is based on today.

In conclusion, I don't support the statement that the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully while we are still young. Do our best  today---- this is the most important and best way!
