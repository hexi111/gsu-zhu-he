I agree with this idea, but I aslo disagree some parts.
First af all, Palnning your life is the most important task for becoming adult, so if a person has a dream it would be easier to decide which school or training you should go. It will save money and time.
Another reason is that palnning carefully is good idea even though you are young or not. Some people keep changing thier mind about thier majors or future. I think being patient is important essence for our life. So I support that careful planning is good for everybody.

However, I disagree with the idea that "a good future for yourself." What is a good future? Who can masure it? Do we have to think about "a good future" all the time? I do not think so because "a good life" is our own values, so I cannot say planning carefully helps for a good future for yourself.
Second reason is that young people learn many things through their experiences. Lots of different experiences will gain our social, problem solving, and communication skills. Even though a person's plan is rough his/ her experiences support thier future. Their plan should be flexible, and adults always support them when they need.
The last reason is that some cultures, for example Japan, have a idea that young people should get into a good university for a good future. There is no young people's decision. Everybody is going to, so that is why I am going to. For parents, getting into a good university is a careful plan for thier children's future. However, for children there is no motivation to study because they believe that they can have a good future because they get in a good university. This is really ironic reality, but this is a part of cultures.
In conclution, Besically, I agree with this idea, but adults have responsivility to support young people to make decisions. In addition, "a good future for yourself" is not same for everybody, so there is no masurement for it.
