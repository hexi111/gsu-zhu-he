Personal appearance and fashion seem to dominated many people's life nowadays. It is often seen that women with bags of clothes and shoes on thier hand on the streets, and people chat over tea time, thinking about how to make their appearance better and dress more fashionable. However, while it seems understandable for people to have a better outlook, recently years have seen a growing emphasis on personal appearance and fashion and this phenomenon has become an issue to be concerned about. 
The over-emphasis on one's appearance and craze for fashion can twist one's value. For example, from one of the most popular TV show, "Sex and the city", we could see that having a better material life dominates these four women's life. And this is not just a TV show, but a reflection of many people's way of thinking. However, when more and more people delve into this endless chase for the superficail level of life, the importance of having a spiritual life will be sacrificed. 
These days, personal appearance and fashion have been put too much emphasis and this phenomenon seems to be a huge influence from the mass media. Yet, could we argue that if we change the topics mass media discuss about, we could improve people's obsession with their outlook? Is it such an easy task to simply change the media or is it more an issue of the change of values of the society that make this problem so prevalent? If we do not have "Sex and the city". will we less concern about our outfit? Does people's belief really a product of the media? Or has fashion become a household name that we all know but less aware of its impact on our life? In reality, we might have become one of the victims who  are influenced by the material world and obssed with how we look. It is not an easy task for us to say no to the fashion world or to not think about how others judge how we look!
