Introduction
Appearances are deceptive and I truly believe this fact. I would categorize people into two where the first set of people dresses up for their satisfaction and there is this second set of people who use this activity to mask their inefficiency. 

As I'm a biologist I would rightly draw an anology between lifestyle and biology. As Parcelsus, the father of modern toxicology puts it that it is the dose that makes the poison and similarly  the degree of fashion which one is attached is directly dependent on the fate of environment. So everything that is been done has to be to a possible extent or boundary and too much emphasis would start in affecting the same.

There are instances where the natural flavor has been detained due to too much emphasis and this changes the environment and therefore people start shaping themselves in accord to the surroundings. Tradition would be destroyed and too much fashion would mask the same. In order to revive that personal appearances and fashion should be in accord to tradition and the extra inclusions should serve to augur the personality.

Too much emphasis in fashion can also create an environment where the people would start thinking that anything and everything in this world can be achieved by a greater degree of fashion. I would rather prefer to use glamour in this case. So the entertainment industry which carries the huge burden of shaping up the environment has to propogate ideas that would use fashion as a tool in shaping up one's personality.

Therefore fashion void of intelligence would move the person till the first goal and in moving himself further would require a great amount of intelligence coupled with confidence.

Finally, fashion should augur up one's personality and should not rule over one's personality. So the line of margin has to be maintained and therefore there should a tint of fashion statement which should augur up one's personality
