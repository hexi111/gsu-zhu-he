Personal Appearence and Fashion are important aspects of our society and to look presentable is important for growth and success. However, now a days people take this in a wrong sense and try to missuse the concept of fashion. I think fashion is considered a style statement. To a limited extent personal appearence counts to a personality. I think fashion is used to get attention of other people. 

Earlier fashion was carried in a decent way on special occasions like parties, or weddings etc. But now people wear makeup and trendy cloths in school. I think it requires a considrable time and effort to change ones appearence. And if its just to show off its a waste of time. According to me personal appearence should be important only to the extent till it does not look ugly or dirty. 

Now a days marketing strategies of various brands exploit people's opinions. I think the more the stock of trendy wear comes in the market he more people want touse it to show off their money and standard of living. Also, due to high level of competition, people now compare each others fashion statements, which overall increases the use of cosmetics and other fashion products. 

People take extra care of how they look and what brand of coths, perfume, cars or accessories they use. 
Fashion has become very important, all across the world, fashion industry is booming. The main reason of their growth is the over emphasis given to personal appearence and fashion. 

Its good that people look good but simplicity is also beauty, which is lost in fashion world. I think appearence should be given importance only to the extent that requires less time and effort and is presentable.
