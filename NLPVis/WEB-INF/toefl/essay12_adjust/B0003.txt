First of all, a careful plan doesn't necessarily guarantee a good future. Man proposes, God disposes. There are just too many factors that could affect a person's future. A lot could happen between when you are young and when you are old. For example, you join the army and  get killed in action. There will be no future for you. Or you are disabled at work, no matter how you craft your plan, the future seems to be out of your control. 

Secondly, while a person is young, there are many other goals he can pursue. If you just think of the good sides of your future, you will probably be restricted to a narrow space, and end up doing something you don't like with a "bad" future. On the contrary, if you forget about your future, and concentrate on what you are interested, you could achieve some achievements, which means the good future will come to you instead.  

Thirldy, you may work for the government, become a policeman, etc., and the future seems to be good, but it is not because of your careful plan, it is because the nature your work. Everyone is almost the same. Strictly speaking, it is not your planning, rather, the government plans for you. 

Finally, I don't mean to live without a plan unless you want to be a vagrant. We all have future, and someday, we all get old, a rough plan is necessary in a sense. Don't stamp on it, future can not be controlled by you, a plan can be made but should not be followed rigidly.
