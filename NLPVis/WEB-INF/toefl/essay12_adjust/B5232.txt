     I disagree with this statement. Plan your life ahead is important but it also can have a negtive effects.  

     Plan your life ahead means you have a high expectation, and that means if you failed at one point in your plan, you might lose all your future. For example, if someone's familly planned to let this kid go to the best college in US when the kid was ten, and sending the kid to many study programs. Most of the time the kids doesn't even know what is so good about that certain college, but they still work hard. People like that might be happy at the end, but i think most of them would be happier if they didn't lock themselves in their life plan.

     People do stop learning until they die. Many news things come out everyday. so i think if you want a good life good future you should have a plan, but please don't lock yourself in it. The world is hugh, there are always something else for you to do. A good future is a good future if you don't enjoy it.
