I strongly agree with the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to plan carefully while I am still young. As far as I known, the ability of learning for a young person is more effective than those of older people. In other words, people keep learrning is the only way to improve themselves so they have a better chance to have a good future. Furthermore, I think that if we can make sure what is our future target as early as we can, so we can focus on our target and then keep the path which set up ourselves, we may have more opportunities to make ourselves succeed.

First of all, I think that learning is the best and the only way to improve myself, no matter how old I am. Actually, many relative research said that the best period of learning is in the young age or people can absorb more information when they are young than people are old. So, that is why people always say young people or children need a better education because young people need a good pattern to follow and to develop a good career from the begining. 

Second, if people can set up their goal when they are still young, they may focus on their ability and then develop these abilities by training themselves. For example, there are many professional and famous athletics in China who have been train since they were kids, or under 10 years old. In other words, these people need much time to improve their skill by practicing. Consequently, most of these athletics became professional. 

In the end, when people are young they have more energy and well-ability for leaning something new or improving themselves. Of course, life is short, the best way to ensure a good future is try to grab everything you need and make a plan for our career plan as early as we can. Maybe people sometimes make some mistakes, but, at least, people can find out why they did these mistakes in the begining and then try to avoid making mistakes anymore. I think that is the most valuable thing.
