I would partly agree with this idea in that we should plan the future financially while we are still young.  Although I think that we cannt buy truly important things such as friends, momories and dreams; it costs some money in order to do anything in this world.  

For instance, I believe my good future comes with my dreams.  When I decided to go abroad to study, which is a part of my good future, I had to be careful in plannning when to start the program and how much money it would cost.  It is because I would have lost the opportunity to do it if I had done something wrong in plannning.  Then, it means that my good future is not ensured.    

Yet, in my opinion, it is great that people explore their lives without any plans after they just picture the future.  It is money that we have to consider in exploring and enjoying our lives.  In addition, the problem here is that we cannot earn a lot of money when we become older.  On the other hand, when we are young, we can work harder and try anything. Therefore, I would mention that a planning a future life financially while we are still young ensures a good future.
