Some people think it is the best way to ensure a good future for themselves is to plan carefully while thety are still young, while the other people think they do not have to do it in their life.  In my opinion, I agree with that I should plan a good future carefully while I am still young.  There are following reasons: find a good job and have a good life

First, I can find a good job if I plan a good future for myself while I am still young.  I will study hard for my education as possible I can.  Furthermore, in this society, I think most company's managers want good employees in their companies, so I have to learn lots of knowledge to improve my ability.

Second, I will have a good life if I plan a good future for myself while I am still young.  At that time, I will have a good salary and do not have to worry my life.  For example, there are many people do not have money and they have to ask someone to give them.  It is because they do not plan anything in their life while they are young.  Therefore, I think everyone should plan their life for themselves.

In conclusion, I agree with that it is the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to paln carefully while I am still young because it can make a good life for myself.
