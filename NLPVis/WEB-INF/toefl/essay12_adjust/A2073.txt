People always think that appearance is very important. When people meet at the first time, they will judge one person's outfit and even their personal appearance. Although this might be very crutial, when you really want to know somebody, you would judge that person from their heart but not their look.

I disagree with people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Why do I say this? It's due to several reasons. First one, appearance and fashion won't stay long. Fashion changes all the time, if we really want to attract people just by our outfit or look. People will think what you reallly have is skin deep. We can see Mother Teresa as an example. She didn't have beautiful clothes, she even isn't beautiful, but I do think she is graceful and with a noble spirit. What can really make people stick together are their personalities and their clothing.Second one, we will miss some chance to meet really good people or even have great friendship. Sometimes we will judge others by their appearance. However, what we really not notice is their heart. Even though that person isn't pretty enough or handsome enough as the big star, they still have something which we can learn from them. I think every one is the same. We can't deny somebody simply because you didn't wear the fashionable clothes. Besides, fashion needs us to invest our money, a lot of people don't even have enough food to eat, how can we use fashion as the standard?

Before I realized the truth, I used to care others look very much. After I listened to my parents' talking and really made some friends who didn't care look at all, I finally understood the really meaning of friend and understood appearance and fashion are just skin deep and they will fade away when years passed by. Thus, a true heart will last forever and ever. That's why I don't support the idea of peple putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
