     I agree with this statement. Many people start doing things like: tanning, plastic surgery or just buy really expensive clothes to become a "better" person.

     It is important that people care about their appearance, it's also normal if you are into fashions. But everything should have a limit. There are few things i can talk about that is not a good way to keep your good appearance or fashion. 

     First you got the guys with really long hair, and they use hair wax to make it they style they want, but to keep their hair stay in that style they need to go to bathroom like every hour or so. Then you got all the people that rush to a store and buy certain cloth just because it's "the fashion". 

     Many people complain about their nature appearance so they go do plastic surgery. I think  changing your appearance by surgery is almost like lie, even though you got what you always wanted. 

     Being a nice person and being a nice looking person is not the same. most the time your appearance to other people is your personalilty but not what cloth you wearing. 

     Nice fashion and good appearance are important to everyone, but if you go to the mall shop for new cloth everyweek or fixing your hair in a restroom for more than ten minutes, that is just not fashion or good appearance anymore.
