Personal appearance is become the most important thing in this society. Indeed, appearance is required everywhere and sometimes it is the only thing that matters. When people think about personal appearance, they usually think about fashion. Fashion or mode is what pushes people to care about their personal appearance. I think that people are emphasising more and more on personal appearance and fashion.

Personal appearance is what help you get a job in some fields. People who works in a bank for example, has to wear a suit and take care of their personal appearance. This is the first thing on what they are gonna be judged. So people are, in a certain way, pushed to emphasis their personal appearance. 

Personal appearance and wear fashion clothes describe who you are. People who do not take care of their personal appearance are generally compared to careless people. When someone has a good personal appearance that shows he/she takes care of him/herself. Moreover, fashion is sometimes the key to help people to have a good personal appearance.  When you wear fashion clothes, especially expensive clothes, that shows you have money and you can take of yourself.

A good personal appearance draws people's attention. Some people like to be seen so they get dressed like stars by wearing fashion clothes. Nowadays society is ruled by beauty, fashion and stars. If you are ugly you have nothing and if you have money you get everything. Ordinary people are not stars but some of them want to be seen as such; so they try to have the best personal appearance in order to draw people's attention.

Last but not least, personal appearance is important. Even if people do not want to look like stars, they want to be well dressed. Appearance is becoming more and more mandatory everywhere so it is easy to understand people's incentivity to personal appearance.
