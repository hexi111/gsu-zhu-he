Nowadays more and more people pay increasing attention on their personal appearance and fashion. And some people argue that these people put too much emphasis on what they look like and what they dress. However, in my opinion, as to most individuals, it is suitable to pay such time and energy on the personal appearance and fashion.

First, everyone in the world love beautiful things. In such case, if we could make us much more beautiful by wearing fit clothes or make up, it could make both ourselves and other people around us much more comfortable. Besides, when others give good comment on our appearance, we would feel happy and robust to do our work, consequently increasing the work efficiency.

Second, pursuing pretty appearance and fashion could be one of important parts in our lives. Please take a few minutes to think out, why do we need to work hard everyday until totally exhausted? No doubt, many persons will answer that they want to earn as much more money as possible. But how do we deal with the money? Just put them in the bottom of our money boxes and dream that it could become more by themselves? Or make use of them to make our lives much more comfortable? I guess most people will choose the latter way. With the hard working, we could obtain more and more money, and then we could consume them by the stuff to make ourselves much more attractive and our lives much more wonderful. That is one of the most important incentives for people.

From what have been discussed above, we could conclude that it is reasonable that nowadays individuals pay much more attention on their personal appearance and fashion. And it is also a good way for people to relax themselves and enjoy their lives.
