Whenever we go somewhere or just get outside we try to look well. We dress up nicely, spend some time looking into the mirror, spray porfums on our body just to look better. Yes, it is a good thing to show youself appropritely. Yes the society is develooing, and dictating new rules, even about the people's appearance. And I agree that "Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion." Our personal apperane became to us as one of the most important aspects in our life. And we make a lot of affort and unbelivable things in order to look more beautiful.

The fact that  nowadays people spend more than two hours on bathroom and other stuff before getting out home wonders me a lot. It means such people do not appreciate their time. They are spending to much time on unnecessary things, and leaving very few time on important ones. Such people also spend less time with their family, and this leads to different problems. And I think that there such people has more chaces of being along. And it is sad, is not it? 

On the other hand, some people find their faces not good enough, and make some oppirations. Their change their appearance. In my opinnion it is not right. Our body and our face was given to us, and we can not make such decissions as changing it, making operations. And I hope that people we understand it, and will stop such a foolish deeds. 

Times is on of the most important things in our life. We have some time, but we  do not know how much? So we need to appreciate and respect it. Some lets spend our time wisely, and spenf it on important things and important people in our life, because who knows how much we have?
