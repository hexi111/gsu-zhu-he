Everybody gets old, and old bodies functions will be less strong than young ones both in mentally and physically. To ensure a good future for myself, I agree that I have to plan carefully while I am still young.
     
     Almost everyone starts our school lives around five or six years old. In my school life, I remember that every teacher put emphasis on the importance on learning as much as we can when we are young. The reason is that we can memorize things easier and faster, and our comprehensions are stronger. Young kids or young people like challenging. When they see something different, curiosity drives them to explore. As the saying goes, "Old dogs can't learn new tricks." With time passing by, people may be feel comfortable with the same things surrounded. If we don't learn in our youth, it's harder to make an old man study. Most of the time old people have slow motions, disease, or bad memory, and those are the factors which could affect learning. We should fill our mind sufficient food for future use, and urge ourselves to learn all the time.

     Working is another important part of our lives, and most people have to work in order to get paid. When we start our work, it means we are preparing for our future. As a matter of fact, everyone cares about a good retirement life. We have to invest our salaries on multiple ways, such as deposit, stocks, insurance, or real estate. We would get a great deal of feedback if we invest money when we are young. Everyone should manage his money well and then he could have a respectful retirement life.
     
     Health is also a factor for a good future. We should have the habits of exercising in our youth. Keeping a good habit will make our lives easier. Besides, we should keep it in mind that choosing healthy food is also important to our bodies. Both exercise and food will make our bodies healthy. If we could have these ideas in mind, our future would be wonderful.
