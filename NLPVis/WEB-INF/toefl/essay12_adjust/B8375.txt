I disagree that the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to plan carefully while I am still young.

In generally, life its self is unpredictable, and sometimes we need to try new things to create another possibles.

The followings are the reasons why I disagree planning carefully while i am still young.

First, I think that people should know themself first then try to do some plans for themself. If a young man did not understand himself how he can plan carefully while he is still young? That kind of plans should be called "dreams".  However, a plan need to be considered as progressive. For example, I got to plan that I need to complete my academic then go to work or I work while I still study in school. Acturally, it is not a plan, it is just a decision. A plan should looked like this: I could finish my college study in three years, I could enter banking industry and I want to retire before fifty...etc. However, god knows I will be that kind of live even I study and work very hard. Only few lucky people could live by their means. I admit that I that kind of people who full of stamina to complete his plans or dreams. But I enjoy my life, I love to discover suprise things in my life and I have courages to solve every uncertain things in my life.

Moreover, people who like to believe their calful plans are somewhat perfectism. There are always some thing different with you percept. Some people would feel angry to these uncertain things just because they do not know these or these things out of their plans.

In conclusion, I would not to plan carefully while I am still young. In the other way, I want to try many thing I like to and gain more experience and knowledge. After these, I would like to plan my else life. I believe that only having enough experience and knowledge, I can  have a great plan.
