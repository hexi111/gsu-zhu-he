People have pros and cons. Some people may assert that if you want to have a good future, you should plan yourself carefully when you are still young. Others may believe that you should try everything you want or take the risk when you are a young man. According to my experience, I deem that we should try everything or take the risk when we are still young. There are several critical reasons to reinforce my opinion.

To begin with, the first ideas to support my opinion is that marketing is our best teacher. It is a good principle in the business market. When you are still young, you have more costs to face the difficulty. You have to try everything you want in order to improve yourself. Markteing will be your best teacher. It will not only make you lost something but also tell you how to be a winner. However, your adventage is the younger age. You can have much time to try again to a successful man in the future.  

Indeed, under some circumstances, we cannot ignore that careful planning is also a key point to ensure a good future. However, if you get used to plan everything carefully, you will miss the chance. Because you would like to evaluate everything perfect before you take an action. It will make you miss a lot of opportunities. That is why I believe that we should take more risks when we are still young.

All in all, Judging from the reasons given in the aforementioned paragraphs, the conclusion is so obvious. The ideas provided in the contents are not only sound but also solid. I, without any doubt, can come to the most reasonable conclousion that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to try everything or take the risk as possible as you can while you are still young.
