Planning ahead later is very importand for a good future. In fact, there happens many unexpected events that make us to change our plan are waiting for us. However, plan is the outline that makes possible us to look ahead our life. Once we set the big picture of our life, we can change the details depending on the situation. The following are examples I've got to the importance  of plan in my life.

First, planning has been helping me in my studying. I started my studying last semester. As an international students, studying in U.S. was not easier to say than to do. The more tough to me was complicated due dates each course I took required. At first half of semester, I sometimes did not meet them. As a result of it, I almost gave up my study. But things have changed since I noticed that I was the only one who did not use calendar. According to the advice from classmates, I bought it and started to write every due date there. And I also made my own due dates for my course term papers. Once I was done with these planning stuff, I could build other details to meet due dates. Finally, I could finish my first semester successfully. If there were no diary and classmates to give advice, I could not succeed. This experience let me know the importance of planning.

I assume that this will be applied into the life. Life has unnumberable changes. But well built plan will prevent us to frustrate. So it should be made ahead. That is, the earlier we plan, the better.
