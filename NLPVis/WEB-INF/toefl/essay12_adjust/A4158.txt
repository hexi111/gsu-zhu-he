yes i agree, if you look good and wear good. then this will reflect your professionality. this is very true, and no one can deny it. lets take the employment part, if you look good and have the requiered degree, what ever your professional skills are, this wont affect the acceptance. espicially customer services and marketing fields. 
 Television and media concentrate on the out look which made us think that your appearance is who you are.        
  for instant, kids would like to follow thier special character customes. and they keep a look at what their peers in school or neighoborhood have.
 for teenagers, celebreties are thier ideal people and they follow their fashion steps.
 while in adults perspective, they prefer the brand names and fabric quality. 
  still, in all ages and generation this focus more in women than men. this lay more in females, following the last kind of clothes and wear new colors and accessories just to sutisfiey others or to get accepted in their environemnt. 
 i should admit that the out side look refelct who you are and where are you belong to. this much more distinguished beyond rich and well-known people.
 it is so amazing how all cultures have the same mentality but in deffrient styles. for example, indian beauty aspects and fashion style would look complitly diffrent from american one. same goes to the whole cultures.
 media and fashion designers affect us if not all of us but most of us. and for this reason, i would insist that professinal look should be teach in schools beside the other degrees.
