To plan carefully is sometimes a good thing but you cannot plan everything. When you are young, it is true you have to think about your future but you do not have to plan it. 

Young people have to enjoy life because they will have all the time necessary to plan their future. Indeed, when you are young you want to hang out with your friends, go to the cinema and do what all young people do. For example, if a young person decide to plan his future instead of enjoying life, he is gonna be stressed, he could not be relaxed. Moreover, parents are there to ensure a good future for their children. As long as they are young people, they have to enjoy life and think about their future later.

Usually when people do plans they do not follow them. A plan is generally precise and you have steps to follow to reach your objective. Young people do not like rules, they like doing things whenever they want to. If they plan carefully their future they will not have a chance to change it; they will not be any surprise in their life. For example, if a young person decide to be a doctor, he knows he is gonna need money so he is gonna have to find a job and work everyday to save money but that is not a young person's life. 

Young people can have some ideas about their future but they are not able to plan carefully their future. To plan your future you need experiences, you need to have knowledge and be really sure about what you want to do. So, you cannot plan something you do not know a little. For example, a young person can decide to be a doctor but he/she does not know it takes about 8 years; maybe after high school the young person would stop school. In any case, you cannot really plan to far because you never know what your life will be.

Last but not least, you can plan in short term but in the long term you need to wait a litlle bit in order to acquire experience.
