It seems that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Firstly, there are a lot of shows on TV to talk about the hairstyle, clothing and fashion that are popular among stars in Hollywood. Secondly, there are shows on TV and published magazine to teach people to dress, to do hairs and makeup. Thirdly, people spend more and more money on their clothes, clothing and cosmetics. However, I don’t agree with this statement.

Firstly, I think people watch shows and read magazines about how to dress, do hair and makeup and fashion mainly for entertainment. They may do occasionally on the specially occasion, like Christmas Party, Halloween Party. However, for most people they won’t dress fancily on their daily life. Secondly, as far as I am concerned, most people put their energy to their work, their inner beauty instead of their outer appearance. Most people that I know study hard to increase their skill, to become more knowledgable, work hard to support their family, and help others by doing volunteer work. Thirdly, in my opinion, people should pay some attention to their personal appearance. Normally, when we look good, we feel good. For example, if one day someone dresses well and goes to the office and the colleague praise: “ Nice dress!” I think this praise will make the person happy for that whole day and increase work efficiency. Although the money that people put into their personal appearance increased a lot compared with previous, it is not too much.

Therefore, I totally disagree with the statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion not only because that most people in daily life put their energy in study and work instead of personal appearance but also because people should pay attention to their appearance.
