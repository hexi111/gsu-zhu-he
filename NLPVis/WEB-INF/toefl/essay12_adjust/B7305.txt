From when you are very young you can try to get some good habits. Examples can be starting to everything well from you are younger, doing all the homework from the first day you start. This will make everything later much more easier at school and at work when you are getting older. Get the habits of trying to understand math, language and so on from day one. It's so difficult if you don't learn how to learn the basic of classes and then to go on to the next level, the level change won't feek like it's that big of a gap. You can imagine yourself the phrase "you can't learn to walk, before you have learned to crawl". This phrase pretty much explaines everything I just explained. Always try to do your best in everything you do, if you just do that, you will always achieve some kind of a nice future. When you still are young you should keep yourself active with some kind of activities to ensure that you are able to other things besides school. This will ensure that you will have energy enough to have fun and enjoy what you are doing. Fun, a short and kind of funny word. However, it's really important to have fun and enjoy yourself, otherwise you won't do your best and you will feel that most things are boring and you will lack motivation to a lot of things. When you are young you can decide to be really good at school, a sport, playing a instrument and so on really quick, and if you start younger to learn it, the better chance you have to succeed with whatever you want to do later in life. For example, if you want to go to a university and study science, it's really important for you to both understand math, physics and so on and to get good grades to get an admission ticket from your college. If you take the example of most students at universities, they have been studying and living pretty well throughout most of their life to accomplish the goal of getting admitted.
