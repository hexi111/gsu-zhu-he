Nowadays, people really care about what other people think about them. We all want to look pretty and handsome because we all want to look attractive.

Therefore, I do think that people put too much emphasis on persomal appearance and fashion.

First, people would spend a lot of money on their appearance. Some people would buy alot of shoes and clothes because they think they must have the lattest trends so they can be fashionable. Also, some people would go to salon so they can have the  hair cut that fit them and make them looks better.
