The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.

I partly agree with this statement, because I think you can ensure your future even when you are older, but I do think that that is going to be more diffult than when you are young. However it is possible.

But my reasons to believe why it is the smartest to try to ensure your future while you are young are the following:
- When you are young you have a whole life in front of you, so you have the time to make mistakes, to learn, to look for several ways to ensure a good future. 
- When you are young it is easier to attend school, since researches have found that children and young people are better able to learn things and memorize them, so it is easier for younger people to absorb knowledge and to focus on getting a good degree which can enable you a good job and a good future.
- Another reason why it is better to start young with ensuring your future is because when you are young, you do not have as much responsibilities as you have when you are older. That also gives you more time and space to get a better education.
- Another thing is that if you make loads of money when you are young, you can also invest it when you are young, which would mean that you can earn loads of interest in the future in the form of interest in a bank, or get rich in real estate. 

So when you are young, you have loads of opportunities, almost no responsibilities, time, space, just everything that is beneficial and helpfull in giving you the chance to ensure your future as soon as possible.
