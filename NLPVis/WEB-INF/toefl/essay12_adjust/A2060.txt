I disagree with this statement. Nowadays people do put a lot of emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, but this is not too much in my opinion. 

Indeed, it is not surprise to find that lots of women, especially young ladies are keen on fashion. For example, many of my girl friends subscribe fashion magazines. And we love to talk about fashion, secrets to keep young, and magic cosmetics. And I would say, fashion is a typical topic of women forever. As a girl, I love the fashion topic, too. I think fashion is a good thing not only because it makes us look prettier but also because it makes us feel more confident and happier. There is no doubt that people look the best when they are healthy and happy. 

Also, in my point of view, seeking fashion is a very normal thing for human, because all people have the desire of good looking. It makes you feel more confident when your appearance is better. 

However, I do not agree with some people who put so much emphasis on personal appearance that they judge other people simply by their looks. In their point of view, a person is his or her looks. If you are handsome or pretty and well dressed, they are going to respect you. By contrast, if a person’s look is not good, they look down upon you. And I do not think this is right. What I want to say is emphasis on personal appearance does not equal to that you can judge people by personal appearance. 

In summary, I would like to see people pursuing good appearance in a healthy way.
