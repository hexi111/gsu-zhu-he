What is a good future? The answer might depend somewhat on individual, but at least a good future refers to be wealthy enough to survive in the society. Thus, getting a good job would be the first priority for a good future, and in order for people to gain a better job is to receive higher education as many statistics indicate. I believe that to receive higher education, which leads to a good future,  people need to have specific plans for future during thier youth, and there are several reasons for that.

The earlier, the better to obtain good education  because of biological reason. Medical research shows that brain cells will increase until twenty five and start to decrease afterwards, so it is true that while you are young, it is easier to memoraize or interprit subjects. 

Another reason for planning for future is that there are importan decisions while you are still young such as which school you go. It could be medical, law, or science. Without plans, you tend to choose wrong way that is not appropriete with your potential, and turn around later on.

With plans and being prepared for future, people tend to have a better life later because it would be easier for them to receive good education.
