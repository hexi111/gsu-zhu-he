Fashion has always been a big part of our lives especially for women. Women have always had the desire to look perfect with flawless make-up and hair, combined with the clothes and accessories that follow the latest trends. This ambition for perfection has increased significantly over the past few years due to the increased media attention on celebrities styles. One can always turn on the television and find a show on the "Best Red Carpet Looks" or "Jennifer Lopez's Beauty Secrets".

Most of us would give anything to look like a celebrity and I believe that all these television shows on fashion & celebrities making it look like it so easy to actually look like one and not realize that they have their own stylists, make-up artists, all kinds of assistants that help them with their looks while they just sit back and enjoy being flawless. Still, the television shows and the weekly magazines make it sound like it is so easy that we try every single fashion tip they give us. If I see Jessica Simpson wearing a cute pair of jeans that make her figure look great, I am most likely to go go and but the same exact pair just to see that they look totally different on me. 

There is also the new "celebrity brands". Everyone has their own perfume, clothing line, shoe brand, etc. Those brands are also money traps too. If the celebrity we like comes up with a new fragrance, we go ahead and buy it right away, we believe that since the person is famous, it has to be a good product.

I agree that the importance of fashion and personal looks in our lives has significantly increased and the media and celebrities are the ones that are responsible for this increase.
