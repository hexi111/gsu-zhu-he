Nowadays people are very much occupied with the way they present themselves to society. AS a result of the fashion boom that is taking place everywhere, usually people are not satisfied with the way they look. Much emphasis is being given to the dress code of both men and women as for some people the way one dresses reflects one's personality, social and economic class. Teenagers are greatly affected by this trend as they are bombarded by T.V and fashion shows all the time about how and what they should dress to look stylish and cool. A lot of these programs push teenagers to dress in a provocative way in which they usually seem older than they really are which bother their parents as they see their children following these trends blindly. 

In the work place, people have to pay special attention to how they dress and they have to match their clothes in a way that makes them look elegant yet stylish. In companies where people have to make presentations all the time and meet different customers, the way they present themselves is very important as they have to dress in formal clothes rather than casual because their personal appearance in this case reflects their professionalism. 

Accordingly, some people have to allocate a portion of their salary to buy clothes and accerssories because they cost a lot. People sometimes resort to second hand clothes that still look decent because they can't affor to buy new ones which often burdens low and middle class people as they might feel that they are not judged for who they are but rather for how they look.
