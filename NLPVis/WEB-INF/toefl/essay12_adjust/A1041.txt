Everybody wants others to think he/she is such a nice person. Many people intend to attract others only by dressing and decorating themselves fashonably. However, it is important to say that people should emphasize and value internal looking rather than external looking because personality counts more to others, and emphasizing personal appearance will distort true value of people.

No matter how you dress and how handsome or beautiful you look, if you do not have good personality, it does not count anything for others. It is true that first impression is important, and people determin his/her personality based on the impression. However, if you are rude and has bad behavior toward others, they will redraw the impression and treat you as you behave.

Another reason for why people should not value personal appearance and fashion is that with trend of fashion, people would be brainwashed and believe that how they look is the most important element of people's value. 

There is something that people should value more than how they look, and emphasizing fashion makes people forget the fact and also the fact that inside of person counts more than outside of person.
