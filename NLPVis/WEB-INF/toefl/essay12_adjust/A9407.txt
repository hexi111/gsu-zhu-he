I am not completely agree the statement that excessive emphasis should be paid to personal appearance and fashion , but personal image is also important. 

Solely focus on personal image would only defy the importance of one's insight. It will be more correctly to judge a people by his or her mind, which would easily be faked by the outlooking these days. For example, famous scientist and giant Elinstan was not favored by other people at first because of his normal appearance among young scientists those days; however, it did not resist us to figure out he was  excellent in his own physical field. This is a good example to show us that personal appearance cannot stand for everything of one people.

However, in present commercial society, personal appearance is also important in many fields. Fast running speed cannot allow people to spend a lot of time to observe one people carefully and judging his or her appearance is always becoming the most easiest way to know a person. For example, good appearance, these days, has become a pretty important way to see a company. Employee's proper clothes wearing and good manner is important to one company's image, which is the best way to leave customers the good impression. 

As a whole, excessive emphasis on personal appearance would only lead us to know a person in a wrong way, yet appearance, in the other way, is also important in that  it would give other people the first good impression.
