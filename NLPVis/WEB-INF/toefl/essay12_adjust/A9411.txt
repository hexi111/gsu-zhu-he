Most of people are apt to emphasis too much emphasis on their appearance. Some poeple agree with that and others do not. In my opinion I disagree with the statement. It is becuase these days we don't have proper criteria to judge other people and good looking is one of the proof of their endeavour.

First of all, When we meet people at first time, there is nothing to judge the person. If we have enough time to look at the psrson, we can get to know his/ her personality and character. However, we don't have enough time to get to know someone and it is natural to emphasis on personal appearance.  

Second of all, if someone has good-looking and sophiscated appearance, it is also one of the essential thing to appeal to others. For example, imagine someone who has good appearance. He or she could be working out everyday. Of course, they can have their appearance when they were born. However, if someone has good appearance, it is obvious that he or she spend time and endeavour on their appearance.

To sum up, it is said that people put too much time on their appearance. I strongly disagree the statement it becuase appearanca is also one of the cirtieria to judge people and  their appearance can show their time and endeavour. In korean saying, better looking, better taste.
