Some people say it is the best way to plan one's future while you are still young for successful future. However in my opinion, it is not necessarily the case all the time. Of course, it is a good way to plan your future while you are still young, but what important is to make sure to leave other possible choices, especially, in terms of their future carrers. Besides, even though it could be important to plan their future carefully when they are still young, it does not mean you can not become successful if you fail to prepare for it when you are young. 

To plan carefully about future while they are young would be a good way to lead a good life, but it is not a good idea to forse young people to decide their future. There are some reason for that. forst of all, young people have many opprtunities and choices, so it could be disaddvantage for the person to make up his ot her mind and not to see other alternatives when they are still young. Therefore, it is better to hold some possible choices and be flexible about their future, especially in terms of their future carrer.  

In addition to that, "The best way is to plan carefully while you are still young." sounds like people can not be successful when they fail to accomplish it, but it is not true. For many people, their turing point in their life is not necessarily when they were young. I know many people who accomplished something began to work for it relatively in later age.  

All in all, although to plan carefully about their future may be one of the best ways to lead a good future, people can be successful even though they do not plan ahead or start to pursue something when they become adults.
