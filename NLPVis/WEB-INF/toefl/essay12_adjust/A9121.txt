   All people have a dream to be beautiful and unique from the past to now. Because of their tendency, they consider their personal appearance and fashion. Although some say that nowdays that is too much, I would like to say that is not too much. 

   Fisrt of all, paying attention on personal appearance and fashion is another way to express theirselves. They preen their appearance and clothings to show who they are in an appropriate way so that others can think "you know and love yourself!" For example, If I go to an interview without appropriate appearance and clothing, I could not be recruited for any companies. Taking care of my appearance is the best way to show who I am in the first meeting. It does not give a prejudge about me to others

   Furthermore, comparing the past time, the current people is not to much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Let's think of our ancients. In the past time, they also considered their appearance and fashion to be beautiful and get an attention from others. We can see a lot of treasures which is related to the trims that decoreated their body, hair, and clothings. Although those look like not good, and not beautiful from the perspective of the current people, I think our ancients made them with the materials that they could handle. They did their best to make their trims.

   In conclusion, I think that nowdays people do not pay attention on personal appearance and fasion too much. Comparing the past time, it is normal. And, we need to preen our appearance to show that I love myself, and give good impression to others. Of course, that is problem to pay attention on only physical apperarance.
