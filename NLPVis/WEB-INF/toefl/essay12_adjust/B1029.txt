I am studying to be a businessman and I always hear that planning is the most important and the always underestimated, underweighted part of a new project. That's why I think that I'm biased answering this question.

Planning or living day by day (carpe diem) can also be a cultural question. People living in the south (Italy, Spain, Latin-America) are known as not very good planners. It is mainly because they are passionate, they overflow with emotions. This is a thing what girls really like, but this is a quality which is totally against reliability. The more you go to the north, the more calm people you find. This means that they are not so hot-headed, they don't lose their mind so quickly and they are more reliable.

Planning requires reliability. How can you plan for a long time if you don't know what's going to happen in two weeks time?

As far as planning while you are still young, I have to say I agree with the sentence above. I am the type of person who cares about his future, and I also have plans for my next couple of years.

I highly agree that good planners have the ability to see the upcoming future in a different way, and they can change the future to their advantage. What I don't say is that this is the better way, though. They will probably be more successful in their business life, but maybe not in their family life. Planning has also some positive side effects. If you had planned something and it didn't happen that way, you were probably also prepared for other outcomes as well. This means that you don't percept the whole thing as a disaster, because you are already prepared for the other outcomes.

Talking about planning the whole life in an early age - it is impossible. There are too many variables in the equasion that are impossible to predict.

Conclusion: I agree with the above sentence, that planning is basically a good thing. You can avoid many unexpected troubles just by planning and you can also be prepared for them.
