I think i agree with the statement. To achieve a goal you first have to plan ahead and see what is necesary to reach that goal. If yoy have everything planned, and for some reason you are not getting what you wanted, then you can make changes and see beforehand the impact of those changes in your planned future. You would have a clear vision of what new changes you might have to take to keep on track.

Is it necesary do plan while you are young? it might depend on the person. For some people, reaching a goal might have a time limit, for others it might not. Not all people have the same idea about what a good future means. For some people it would be about money, for others it might be about happyness and love. That's why i think that planning for your future while young is not really necesary. it actually depends on the person, and the type of future that the person wants.

For example, for some people a good future would be to have a good paying job and have a comfortable life. Then the person might plan on moving from place to place applying for some jobs, and then pick the one that pays the most. For othe people with the same dream, it might be different. In order to get a good paying job, the person might want to go to college, get a dregree, or a masters, etc. His dream would take more time to achieve. Therefore, planning for your future while young is not really necesary.

I think however that planning while young might have better results, and that it would definitely ensure you a good future. It is a good idea to plan while you are young because then you would have more time to live through and enjoy your future.
