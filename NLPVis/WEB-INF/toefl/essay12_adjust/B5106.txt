I personally agree with the statement. I think that the best way to ensure a good future for ourselves is to plan carefully while we are still young.

I think the word "young" here is considered as "early". To plan everything early is always a good idea because we can counter problems that might be arised later by planning ways earlier. 

Education when we were toddler supports one to have good future. Parents teach their children materials when they were young, to give them basic knowledge of how to think logically. For example, parents can teach reading when their child is still 1 year old. Well, in this way, parents have already planned a good future for the child.

I have experience on this topic on myself. My parents planned my education when I was still young. They prepared it much earlier than most people usually do. They planned my high school education when I was still in elementary school, and my college education when I was still in junior high. I think their plan works really well. I feel I'm walking the right path that my parents have designed for me. Well, I didn't have to agree to everything they said.

So, I will always agree to the statement that planning early can lead us to good future.
