I agree that the peole put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. We mind how we look. It is really important in our environment especially if we are working and if we are known by many people. Known by many people does not mean "famous". It may be because of your family. We have to look nice so we will put too much emphasis on personal appearence and fashion.

At the same time putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion is because of envy. It is like being a child. When I was child I was very envy to my sisters. they were adult and they were looking very pretty and I wanted to be like them. It was a child mind. If we have someone in our environment who is reaaly fashionable we envy them and we try to be like them. So too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion happens. Also the TV, magazines and famous people envy them. I'm not saying all of us envy someone but many of us envy someone.

It is not awful putting too much emphasis on people appearance and fashion. After everything, the result is "Self confidence"
