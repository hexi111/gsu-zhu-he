     I agree with the way to make a detailed plan from young age because well-organized plan helps me ensure to live better life. 

     I can get more time to think about what I want to do and have to do to accomplish my goal, compared to the situation I don't plan to make sure the way that I have to go. With more time, I can think the better way to obtain values, qualities that I want to have or need. It enables to accomplish the goal efficiently and effectively.  

     Furthermore, the goal motivates me to study or work hard. Thus, it prevents me waste time. I can manage my time well. For example, I have been planning to study abroad since I was a middle school student. I studied English and Chinese, and I'm studying in the United States now. The plan made me spend time studying other languages, instead of watching dramas or sleeping too much for my free time.    

     Planning is like an anchor. It is useful to set a certain goal. It is helpful to maintain positive attitude for my future. Thingking in a positive way offers a lot of opportunities to make great effects. I know what I have to do and what I can get if I behave in the same way that I planned. I don't need to be nervous and self-confidentless anymore. Therefore, I think that the eariler I make a plan, the better my future will be.
