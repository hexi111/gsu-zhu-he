I agree that planning carefully while you are still young is crucial. Although some people would say that it's never too late to start a new career, your career comes from how you plan well and how you perform it. Thus, if you can plan in advance and fulfill it step by step, you definitely have a better chance to reach your goal.
   
First of all, good future comes from the past and present. For instance, one who wants to become a professor can never become a professor without obtaining the diploma first. Thus, he or she should plan in advance to see what specialties he or she wants to focus and how he or she can reach the goal. If not, or if he or she plans it when gettings old, it will be much difficult and waste much more time.
  
In addition, if one hastily plans every step, he or she may not be able to overcome some obstables if he or she does not foresee them in advance. A person with widsom should take much more details into consideration and consider each related aspect. In this case, he or she will be prepared enough to solve problems better. Without any training before, he or she may be timidated and lose control.
  
To sum up, in order not to waste time, it is best to have plans in advance and complete them on by one.  When you are still young, you have plenty time to train yourself and reach each goal one after one. Even though you will face some obstacles, you can handle them better since you have foreseen the problems. Thus, in order to ensure a better futrue, you should plan carefully while you are young.
