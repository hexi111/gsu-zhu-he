A bright future is not something that can be created within a short period of time. Many young people may not care about it until later on they regret about their past experiences. I strongly agree that the best way to have a successful future, one has to carefully plan at a young age. I still hear this statement from my parents  every day, usually remind me in education. Based on many facts and evidences, a planned future will always turn out better than a unplanned one for many reasons.

One reason is when you are still young, you will have plenty of time to think about what you would like to do for the future. Even if you choose a wrong field of study, you can still go back and change. On the other hand, if one decides to plan for the future whenever he feels like it. One day, he will realize it is too late to turn back from his old age or other inevitable obstacles. 

Another reason is when you are young, your mind may think better. Some studies reveal a young brain can think faster. Therefore, one should cherish this privilege that he has and use it wisely. 

Overall, in order to prepare a bright future, one has to put out some efforts and time. Everything always has its pay back. Hence, young people should use those spare time that they have now and prepare for the real world that they have to encounter in the future.
