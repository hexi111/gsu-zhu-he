I do not agree with the statement that a good plan in the early stage will always guarantee a good future.  The idea that getting prepared as early as possilbe could definitely help people to bear a goal in mind when they are young and serve as a guidance as they go through their future life. Enormous researches also show that people with a plan normally acheive higher objectives than people who do not have a plan in their early years.  However, it is not always the case.

First of all, life is a forever learning experience.  No matter how well you plan in any stage of your life,  the plan can not be a static thing.  As you experience more in the life, you are keeping revising the plan and make it more suitable to what you really want yourself to be. For example, a friend of mine dreamed of being a excellent athelete when he was a little and later he played professional golf for years, however, an accident broke his legs in his thirties.  He timely revised his plan--chose another major, entered the college and became a professional accountant.  Therefore, the uncertainties that might happen in the life determines that no matter how well you plan for your future, that still does not ensure you a good future. The only thing that ensures such is not the plan itself but rests in the ability for you to be able to adjust yourself to fit into the society you live in.

In addition, as I mentioned earlier, a plan is a good tool to guide you through the life. Bearing a specific goal in mind can help you acheive it more easily. A goal oriented person has more chances to lead to a successful life.

On the whole, I agree that planning when you are young is the best tool to help you acheive what's in your plan, but a static plan can not guanrantee you any good future.
