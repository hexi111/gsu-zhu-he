I completetly agree with the mentioned statement. The future could bring good or bad things, but there is always a part of it that could be predictable. Therefore, one should foresee and plan their future for those thing that one could take care of while one is still young. 

First, when one is young, one has health and energy to do many things, such as: study, work and at the same time have fun. If one decides to study a good career that provides enough money to live decently, one should seize the opportunity to save some of that money. Second if one is healthy, one should keep eating healthy food, go to the doctor for frequent checkups and not forget exercises. Nobody knows how is going to be the future and really nobody cares very much about that, but the future not always is a retired sick person living alone with his cat. The future could be around the corner wainting for us while one is still young. So planning ahead always bring huge advantages, even though if the planning is for tomorrow. 

On the other hand, one should plan what kind of life would they like to have and work hard in order to become their dreams true. For example if one imagines living in a house near the sea, one could start planing how to do it. Defenitely a good future comes with advanced planning and that planning should start when one is still young.
