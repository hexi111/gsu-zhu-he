I agree with this statement. There are basically two functions of wearing clothings; protect ourself from various weather and show our personality through our fashion. I think second reason of wearing clothings is really impotant to live in society.
      
First of all, we get people's first impression from their fashion. For example, if we meet somebody at first time, we will get better impression from the person in case of  we can see the person has nice fashionable taste. 
     
In addition, our nicer personal appearance can help us not only to give better first impression to others, but also make professional appreance. I have an experience with that different appearance can make differnt looking as professional person or not. One day, I had a economics class. When I saw my professor at the first time, my professor wore nice suite for the first class. She looked just like a professional professor with her sophiscated looking. However, she showed up with jean and t-shirt for the next class without her make up on. She was the same person with last time, but for me there were totally two different people.
     
Finally, I think wearing nicer clothing is also help us to have nicer behavior. When I prepare to go out, I wear nice clothing and nice make up on. This action is already makes me happier than wearing not pretty clothings and no make up on. With this nice emotional happiness, when I go out my behavior is also acting better.
      
In conclusion, it is important to have nice appearance because it can help us to give nice first impression to others, look professional, and have nice behavior.
