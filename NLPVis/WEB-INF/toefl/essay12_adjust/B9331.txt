Reports of old people living unhappily in their late years on news is not that uncommon in Taiwan. It makes me wonder why those people didn't prepare their life plan so that they don't have to be what they are right now. As a result, their stories allow me to think this issue ahead. It is best to plan carefully their future when people are young because of sufficient time for preparation.

If one plans his or her future early, he or she of course can have plenty of time for preparation. However, there are many  facets in that preparation. First of all, a long-term and careful plan is the basis of a good future. We all know that haste makes no effectiveness; therefore, it is clear that if we make our future plan under an impoverished situation (e.g. insufficient time for thinking, immediate decision require to be made, etc.), it is impossible that we make a thorough plan which may benefit to us for a long run. To avoid this situation, we have to plan the future as early as possible, enabling a good future.

Things in the world change, so that if we have a plan first, we can deal with the changes with a minimal impact on our plan, and that's another consideration. Think of a person who doesn't have a future plan, so that when things change, he or she may get lost and confused because he or she doesn't know where they should go; in other words, they don't have an life objective to deal with the change. However, a person with a future plan can then have his or her plan revised to adapt the changes, but still the ultimate goal of their plan is unaffected and they can still follow their plans toward the end goal.

In reflection to those old people under miserable late years, it is obvious that to plan the future as early as possible is the best way to ensure a good future.
