When we talk in our daily life, we always say that "time reaally goes past, with an eye blink time". This saying reflect that we have to catch up with the time and believe that every moment in our lifes is valuable. Therefore I agree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for ourselves is to plan carefully while we are still young. 

We are active and healthy while we are young. Therefore we can be more productive. In these years we have more energy to do things for planning our future. Therefore we have to use this energy and save something for our future when we become older. For instance saving some money for the future can be one of the ways for planning today. In the future when we get retired we will need some money for our family, for our health problems and for the dreams that we always want to make real. Therefore planning financial issues is one of the things that can ensure our happiness in the future. 

One of the ways to plan carefully today is deciding on what to do in our future. By doing so we can be more sure about our future and make the right acts everytime. For instance career planning is an important issue which every young people should consider. Through a career planning we can ensure a good future for us which will make us happy and productive at the same the. Planning about the paths that we can follow in our career in early days can reduce the anxiety or indefinity about the future and can make us more comfortable.

Planning carefully while we are still young is an important issue for us to be happy in the future. Saving money today and doing career planning are some of the ways that we can ensure a good future.  We should understand the value of every moment we hava etoday without forgetting the days in the future.  We have to seize the day (carpe diem) but at the same time remember that one day we will die (momento mori).
