Everyone likes a good future: a success career, a good family, and maybe much money and power.  Then, what is the best way to ensure a good future. Some people think there is no need to plan there future when they are young, because they think maybe someday luck will hit them and then the good future will come itself. However, other people think they should plan carefully for their future when they are still young. In my opinion, the best way to ensure a good future is to plan carefully while we are still young. There are several reasons for my opinion.

First, a good future comes from a lot of hard work. If we have planed carefully about our future, about what we shall do in the next 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, then we can worked hard along this way, and get a good future based on these years. But if we haven't planed the future when we were young, now we are old, we want a good future, then we work hard, but before we see our good future, maybe we already don't have enough time. So planing our future when we already old is not a good way to ensure a good future.

Second, we know the chance of luck is very small. For some people they think the luck will give us a good future, I would doubt that. We can calculte the chance to get a loteory, that is very small, the chance to get lucky is similar to this. So, if we didn't plan for our future, if we don't work hard, the chance we get a good future would less than 1%. So waiting for luck is really not a good way to ensure a good future.

Also, even we already plan carefully while we are still young, we may still cannot get a good future, because if we didn't work hard, if we didn't follow the schedule we planed, we still cann't ensure a good future.

In summary, the best way to have a good future is to plan carefully while we are still young. But we may still cann't have a good future even we already planed carefully while we are still young.
