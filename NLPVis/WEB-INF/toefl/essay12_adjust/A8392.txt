Somebody want to show their appearance and make other people knowing they are rich.  They usually put so much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  A good appearance and fashion dress can just explan designeers' ideas.  I have two ways to disagree this statement.

First, I think put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion waste much time and money.  There are so many people make money hard.  They just want to get a hand bag of fashion brands.  Other hand bags is better than fashion's.  But because fashion's are expensive.  So someone want to buy them and just show them to their friends and make their friends know they are rich.  It waste money.

Second, personal appearance and fashion can just show designeers' ideas.  They make fashion things.  They just want to show mainstream fashion.  We do not need to put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

someone oppose my ideas.  Because they think personal appearance and fashion are important.  If you put too much emphasis on personal sppearance and fashion, some people think I am rich.  you put emphasis on fashion.  But you rent house. Can the people trust you are rich?  I think the answer is no.

We can admire personal appearance and fashion; but we cannot put so much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  Because they are just designeers' ideas.  So we can admine; we do not put so much emphasis.
