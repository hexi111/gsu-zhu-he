We should make a plan about what we want to do in a furture, and how we can put a plan to act when we are students.

  While we are students, we have plenty of time to think about a furture. Although school work is sometimes tough, many parents and teachers encourage students to experience outside of classroom as well. Some of students may use time to read novels, and other of them may spend time to hang out with friends. This helps teens think about what they want to be like in a furture, for example what's kind of job they want to have. Plactical experience can give them a significant idea or useful advise about furture.

  After students graduate from school, they usually can't have enough time to consider their lives. People have to make a money to live, but they may become tired after a daily work. This situation is more serious than student daily life. If people get married, and have a baby, a situation will be harder. they have to raise a child, and it means that they have more responsibilities not only for their own life, but also for their children's lives. These life events can be obstracle to think about furture plan in detail.

  Thus, we should plan about a plan when we're young. However, we also need to be flexible about a furture plan becasue nobody knows what will exactlly happen in a furture. Even if an unpredictable incident happens, we have to deal with it correctly as lond as we hope a fruitful furture.
