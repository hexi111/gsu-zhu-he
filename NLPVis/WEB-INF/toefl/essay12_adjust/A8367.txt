When it comes to the question about whether people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, it is unavoidable to have two different opinions. Some people prefer to think that people do put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, while others tend to think that people do not put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I have also come to my own conclusion on this argument. Personally, I agree with that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. In order to illustrate my point, two reasons will be provided. 

The first reason is that too much resources are spent on fashion. If people put these resources on helping poor countries, then there will be no more poor countries in the world. 

The second reason is that natural healthy is the most beautiful thing in the world. Over dressed doesn't  make you look better.

All in all, although some may say that fashion is a well business. But I still feel more confident in my own reasons. Therefore, we can boldly conclude that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
