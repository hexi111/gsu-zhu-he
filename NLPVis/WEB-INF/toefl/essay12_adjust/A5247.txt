It is always said that the first impression is the last impression. So it automatically follows that appearence is important. How you look does matter a lot. Now some might say that beauty is superfiial, you need to go beyond it. When i refere to appearence i refer to appearency in general. Not to how beautiful or ugly one is. I associate adjectives like neat, tidy, and untidy with the word appearence, and not beautiful or ugly. 

Appearence is of utmost importance. Not only in the business words, but in all walks of life. Even in personal life appearence is important. Nobody would like a badly dressed spouse. You wouldn't want to be embaressed because of how someone near and dear to you looks. How you look defines your personality. When you meet a person for the first time you judge him from his appearence. A clean, well dressed person with neately kept hair will appeal to you more than a badly dressed person with unkept hair. Your appearence speaks volumes about your personality. It tells about the kind of person you are. However brilliant you are, you will always remain behind if your appearence is not acceptable. Now why do we dress formally for interviews and presentations? When we dress well and bear a desent appearence we feel more confident. A good appearence is appealing not only to the other person, but also to oneself. It helps to boost our confidence. 

It is often said that you feel the way you look. So inorder to feel good you need to look good. Your first impression is many a times the last impression. So you need to make sure that your first impression is good at all times. And that will happen only if you bear a desent appearence.
