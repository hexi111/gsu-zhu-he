I do not think it is "the" best way but I do think it is one of the best ways to ensure a good future for yourself. 

First, assuming that there is a particular 'good future picture' somewhat very standard, stable, and common to all people across the board in the society, and assuming that you are garanteed to feel satisfied as same as those other people, then I think it is reasonable to plan ahead based on the picture you have in mind. For example, I can think of a simplified situation like the following. Soppose we were living in a scociety that uses language A only, and in which language Band C are taught at school as a second language. Suppose that there will be a point when we have to choose either one of them, B or C. If, for instance, it was a case such that B is mainly used by people having occupation B' and C by C', and if, again for instance, the former normally live in a particular area where you wish to live or you are expected to live.      
In such a case, it seems it is true that planning carefully when young sounds like the best idea. It is not a good idea just to decide what you want to do at some point just because you enjoy it for that time being. 

However, as it always happens, some part of the assumptions might not hold always for all people universally. For example, a term 'good' is always relative and not absolute to us individually. Furthermore, the value can change during a process of living one's life. In a situation above, for example, no one could have expected that the person to regret very much after he or she successfully achieved the original goal because the place he live suddenly got involved in a serious crisis of war.    


For this reason, I shall say it is just one of the best way of thinking to plan carefully while young to ensure a good future but not the only one.
