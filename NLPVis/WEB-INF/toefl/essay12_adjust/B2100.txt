Nowadays, lots of people are debating whether the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan beforehand when you are young. In my opinion, I think having a clear plan in youngster will benefit you very much for someone's future. There are two reasons to support my viewpoint.

First, no matter what you want to do or intend to do should have a plan before you begin which will save you a lot of time in the procedure. Sometimes we don't plan well beforehand,  in that case, we usually stop in the middle to think what we should do next. It is a waste of time because we often need some time to make ourselves calm down first, then think about the next step.

Second, when we plan in youngster, we can assume some problems that we will meet in future. It will make us more easier to overcome those problems, because we have already thought about those problems and we have some  skills to solve the problems. The better you plan well, the brighter your future will be.

All in all, planning for your future in youngster is really important. It will help us reduce some habitation which is  useless in our life.
