I truly agree with this statement. Relating to my personal experience, all of things happening in my life right now are so much related to what I have planned since I was in school years - I completed my bachelor degree studies successfully, be able to get the planned job and now pursuing my graduate studies in one of the best universities in the United States.

It is all resulted from the careful plan I made since I was young. 

Therefore, I strongly agree with this statement. To plan for a good future, you need to identify the strategies needed in each steps undertaken. Suppose you plan to be a successful businessman, typically you will need to start with earning a business degree during your college study – this is called setting appropriate goals. 

To achieve these goals, you will then need to lay out the steps needed, for instance, to identify which business school you wanted to go for your degree. Once you identified the school, you need to know what are the requirements, for instance, specific writing test score that you need to score etc. You’ll then need to carefully plan to score the test, such as enroll in a special English writing class, find a good tutor to help you with the writing, familiarize yourself with different kind of writing styles etc. 

In addition, since planning involves time, it is very important that you plan as early as you can. It is impossible to plan for your future the day before you plan to be a successful businessman, you need to earn the degree which usually takes 3 to 4 years to complete and you need to find appropriate funding resources to fund your studies. All of these need time to be implemented. 

In conclusion, to plan for a good future, you need to plan as early as you can.
