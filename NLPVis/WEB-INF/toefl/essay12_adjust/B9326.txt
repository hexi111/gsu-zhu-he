 "Who do you want to be when you will be a grown-up?"- adults often ask little children. And most of them already know what they are going to be. Some say a spaceman, some say a ballerina, teacher, singer, dancer, doctor, etc. 
Thinking of a future and carefully planing it from the young age is the best way to have a good future.

   Planing future leads to actions that will create one's personality. A person will be certain of his goal and will do his/her best to aim it. Even a child will be playing and acting as a doctor if he wants to become one. His mind will be adjusting to the notion of the world as a doctor in it. And if suddenly he understands that it is not his personality and it is not something he likes, he will think of something else and finally will come up with a certain idea. 

   Ideas for the future will ensure a person that future is something that he/she can expect to be a certain way. Being unaware of the future makes one to feel fear. That is why every person needs to think of his/her future in advance. Planing future makes one to be confident. And it does relate not only to individuals but also to societies and countries. For instance, Kazakhstan is a good example of a country that is the most successful among the one that were a part of former USSR. Kazakhstan has a future plan for over twenty years in advance. This plan is a reason for actions that government takes in order to aim the goal. And as a matter of fact, Kazakhstan is one of the countries that are developing the most rapidly.

   An old Kazakh proverb says: "A man with no dream is a bird with no tree". Creating a future for yourself is the best way to have a good future. Good future is not a certain future. It is future one wills to have and plans to have.
