it is known that time do not wait, to suceed in life everyone need to struggle in a daily basis. But the concern is: shall we plan life early or manage it day by day. According to me success in life depend on a good early planning.

First, let as consider the role of education and training in our life. A child need to get a proper education and traiming early because it will help him in the future. If his parents do not plan for him he may end by not be able to face the challenges of today life characterized by competition. Also, we have today so many opportunities in achieving our dreams, but if there is no plan in terms of life goals we may not be able to use those opportunities to make the difference in our lives and in other peoples lives.

Second, nowadays, a businessman who do not plan strategically for his enterprise will soon have to close because he will be suprised by the reality that  he is not prepared to face. Planning is about forecasting the challenge of the future and seek preventive ways of deal with it. 

As a conclusion, I will say that it is important to know where you are going because if you do not know where you are going, you will have to walk for long time and may end anywhere. Success in life relies on a effective and efficient definition of life objectives, goals, expectations.
