I agree with the idea that people emphasize too much on personal appearance and fashion. We can always watch commercials deliever the messages that being attractive in your appearance is crucial. In addition, we can trace some clues from how people choose their boyfriends or girlfirends and how they decorate themselves through fancy outfits or expensive bags. Moreover, it seems that if you can't be attractive, you will lose some benefits in competing with others. 
   
As we can always see from the advertisement, if we can buy those fashionable products, we can gain more confidence, get better jobs, or attract more attention. This type of message has bombarded our lifes.  Television programs, such as fashion news, or celebrity lifes, always show some skinny actresses and propagate the idea that you should be fashionable enough to gain a better life. 
   
Aside from that, most people choose their partners by their impressions from the appearance first. Therefore, handsome boys or beautiful girls always attract many suiters. We can also see people rank the appearance in their first priorities for dating. If one does not look pretty, he or she will have fewer chances to attract the opposite sex. 
   
In the rather competitive world today, people try to win others in many facets. Hence, even the most superficial one, which is the artificial decoration either in faces or clothing, has become a crucial point. It seems that if you can win in this aspect, you can also win in other aspects. For instance, you can see a person with a nose job tell you how her life changes after it and how she gets a good boyfriend afterward. By word of mouth, people deliever this kind of messages to one another.     
   
All in all, it is apparently that modern people exaggerate the importance of appearance. The old proverb, "don't judge a book by it's cover" is not applicable anymore. We do emphasize the needs for a beautiful "cover."
