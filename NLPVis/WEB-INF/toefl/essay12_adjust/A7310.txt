I agree with the statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  I don't say that you should not care about your appearace and fashion at all, but I think many people care too much.  Let me give you some examples.

First of all, many people like to read fashion magazines and get some fancy clothes or lovely shoes.  I can understand that you want to be like her when you see a beautiful model in magazines.  However, she is not you.  You don't have to follow some models and trends.

Secondly, some people get plastic surgery.  Especially in Korea, it has been very common to do that among young women.  Nowadays, the number of people who get plastic surgery in other countries is increacing.  Isn't it very sad to refuse your appeance by getting plastic surgery?  Think about your parents.  Your face and body are from them.  You should not deny your parents.  I think this is too much emphasis on your apperance.

In conclusion, emphasis on your appearance and your fashion today is too much.  You should not regret your parents.
