I agree with the statement above about that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.  One reason is because the television and the movies, especifically the actress, actors, models and TV hosts are shown like extremely beauty beings and not normal people. Thus, this comes with peer presion. The other reason is that behind all this fashion world there are millions of dollars working, from advertisments to shops. This would not be all wrong if it wasn't because the behavior that people adopt if they don't look like their favorite actress. 

The weakest target is without any doubt teenagers who are more vulnerable to peer presion and also to all the influence of television. It does not matter how much could cost a piece of clothing, if it is fashionable they would do anything to buy it, and then one can see on the streets how an army of teenagers are all dressed the same way, wearing the same shoes, bags, and even makeup. This doesn't mean that older people are not easy targets. They also have a market, like expensive jewlery and perfumes. Appearence is very important, if one does not look well can be reject from society and even their closest friends. 

On the other hand, the money behind this industry is enormous, so there is a constant bombing of new product everyday on television, newspapers, billboards and so on. They know how to use their advertisment to capture people's atention and increse their revenues. 

In conclusion, there is nothing wrong about looking good and be fashionable, but the important thing should be that no one can wear the same thing. Every person is diferent and spend money in unnecessary things only help those people who are behind this industry.
