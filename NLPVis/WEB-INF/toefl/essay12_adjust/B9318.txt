I agree that planning carefully while I am still young is the best way to ensure a good future. I am proud to argue and defend this statement with the example of my personal experience.

I knew that I was going to study in the United States of America when I was in 10th grade. I attended an English class designated for taking TOEFL throughout my 10th and 11th grade. When I began my 12th grade, I took TOEFL immediately and applied to MSU. I received admission to MSU in November, 2004 which was during the first half of my 12th grade. 

Upon entering MSU, I planned all the classes I was going to take each semester. I met with my supervisor regularly and within the first two months we settled down my classes for the following four years. My supervisor always told me that she liked my organization and wished she could have more students like me.

During the school year, I always planned my studying time. Being an international student, it took me a lot of time to study. In addition, I had to take more classes each semester because I am doing double degrees. Planning and making good use of my time helped me to  maintain a high GPA while participating in many extracurricular activities.

I am graduating this following spring with two degrees. Many friends who entered MSU at the same time as I did are graduating one year later with only one degree.  They always ask me how I can finish two degrees in four years. My answer is always the same: planning ahead.
