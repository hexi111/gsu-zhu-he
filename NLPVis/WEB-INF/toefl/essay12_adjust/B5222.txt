Yes i agree with the statement.  The eariler you start to plan your future, the eariler you success in your life. The reason is that you will have more time than other people to collect your experience and save the money. 

You may achieve your goal shorter than others. It can compare with language study. If you learn to speak other language when you were young, you can speak very fluently. Moreover, if you plan to save the money when you were young, you will have a lot of money enough to spend after retirement. However, the problem of planing the future is uncertainty. Most people do not know what they want to do in the future or should do in the future. Sometimes you think you want to be somethings but it does not work well. Otherwise you want to be a big person as president but it is quite difficult to achieve that point. For example, I really want to doctor but i afraid of blood and my grade does not good enough. Sometime you can not garantee your future. Especially in the bussiness world, you may not success everytime. However, the experience which you collected will help you in next step. In some countries, parents influenced thier child future. Many parents believe that they need to plan the future for their children in order to achieve the career in the future.  Most parents want their kid to be doctor or lawyer to make a lot of money. They put them in the medical school or law school to prepare them for future.  Some parents teach their child to play sport when they were young in order to prepare them to be champion in the future. Sometimes their children can move through their goal and success but some of them may not.  Anyway what do mean by good future?

Good future mean rich or happy. It depends on your definition. In buddism, good future it means happy with the things you do. 

So it seems true that you have a good plan then you get good future but it depends on each person that what you called your good future is.
