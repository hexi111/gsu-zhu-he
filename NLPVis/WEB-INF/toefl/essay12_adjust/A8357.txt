First, I would like to say that I totally agree for people puting  too much emphasis on their appearance and fashion. I think the reason that cause this kind of situation to hapeen because of the society that we live now. We live in the society which people usually judge at others by what appearance of them. For example, it would be consider of  high-class by someone who is wearing brands. It will makes people to believe that if they are dressing well that they would get respect from other people. Therefore people would like to put much attention on what they look like not only for the pretty but also the respectaion from others.
