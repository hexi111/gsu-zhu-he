Most important thing that young people concern about is future.What I am going to do after school?What kind of college should I go?Which field is suitable for me?

All these question are waiting to be answered in their minds.Economic conditions,current life situations are directing students to think deep abut future.

What are these all about?All these about are just for money and guarantee your future.This is so strange that if you are interested in sports,arts etc. , your parents try to force you doing another job at an another field.This is because of they concern about your future.They believe you can make more money in other business fields. This doesn`t mean I blame these families.

So planing your future when you`re at 18`s 19`s is the best way.You can choose your field and your college that you want to attend,concentrate in your job.This is a clasical way of establishing you future life.I am sure that everyone can have more money that they expect in 10 years after graduation even in Arts and sports fields.But working hard and being determant is a must.

At developing countries situation is quite different.people concern about their future life more than other developed countries.It doesn`t matter what they do,what education they had.They try to do every job that they can make more money.

Hope globalism rules will change in the future and people will live however they want,they will do the job that they are interested.
