Some people say that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. I fully agree with this argument. Actually doing everything needs planning. By planning when they are young, they will have to think about what their interests are and what they  really want to do in the future. Thus they will do something specific that helps realize their career goal and live an interesting life in the future. 

Good planning makes people think carefully about their interests and their career goal. If you do not plan, sometimes you will not know what you want to to in the future. Since you have a good plan for the future, the plan will guide you in your daily life. For example, if you want to be a businessman, you can read some autobiographies of successful businessmen. You can do some small business in your spare time to experience the real business. 

A good plan does not mean that you can not adjust it if you have changed your ideas. It is certain that you can make adjustments to your plan from time to time. It also means you plan carefully.

There are a lot of examples showing that those who planned carefully while they were young made great achievement in the future. For example, the former Chinese Premier Enlai Zhou made up his mind to study for China's rising. He guided his everyday life with this motto. Without doubt he made successful achievement and realized his dream. 

In sum, it is best for people to plan carefully when people are still young so that they are most probable to have a good future. Once they have their plan for the future, they will know what they want to do and what they should do. They have their life goal and they lead a more meaningful life.
