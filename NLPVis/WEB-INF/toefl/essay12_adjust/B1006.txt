I strongly agree with the idea, the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.  I am 24 years old. I was born in Korea but I spent most of my life time in Japan because of my father's business.  When I did not even recognize and understand what Korean is, I had to learn Japanese in confusion.  This is the losing my self-recognition.  After achieving my farther's business, my family needed to go back to Korea which is our home country.  However, the problem was appeared.  Because of my young age, I had to go to school in Korea.  Whenever I went to school in Korea, I had to experience some difficulties because even though classmates were same grade, I am younger than them.  That is why making friends was so difficult subject for me.  Moreover, they who were go to middle school together did not try to open their mind to me.  From my experience, I had no plan to manage time and make my future because of my father's busniesses.  Regardless of any situation, people should make their future to feel satisfation thenselves.
