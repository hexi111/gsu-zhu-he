The topic that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself  is to plan carefully while you are still young has been argued for a long time. Some people think we should work hard and prepare for the future, while others consider that it is useless to work hard at the young age. As for me, I do not think the best way is to plan carefully in the young.

Firstly, there are many factors which can affect one’s future, such as personal ability, family background, chance of achivement, and the effect of the society. Among them, it’s difficult to decide which one is the best. In some case, one of them will make one’s future in certain circumstance. For example, though a person is excellent, he will not get what he wants if he did not meet the chance of society. On the other hand, in the war, so many people made a big money, is reason is that they met the war.

Secondly, because we’re young, it is difficult for us to decide what we should prepare and how can we prepare them for the future. In the young, we have not known everything completely, and we always changes our minds with the development of the outside world. Possibly, we like music at sometime; when the computer becomes the hot, we could transfer our minds to it. 

Finally, though we could know what we like most, we also cannot ensure there is a bright future due to the fast development of society. It’s very possible that what you prepared for the future has out of date when you are really in the future.
In a words, I do not agree this statement.
