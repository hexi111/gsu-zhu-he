We are often told that we need to start planning ahead because when the time comes for us to start doing what we need to do, things could come out wrong. It is always good to have a strategy.  Another thing that we ofen hear it the phrase "time is money," so if you wait until you are older to start planning your future maybe it would be to late. 
   
When you are young the last thing that you worry about is the future. You only want to live thinking about the present, and often you do no stop to think what may be the consequences of what you are doing.  But as times goes by, you start facing the problems of your previous behaviour and you start to regret it.You need to remember that for every action there is a consequence. So whatever you do when you are young is going to reflect in you adult life.

If you what a good future,  good future meaning you being economically and psycologically stable, in other words if you do no want to have problems you could have prevented when you are older, you need to start planning now.  The earlier you get your outline the earlier you can start working on your project.  

If you start working on your life projects when you are young, you may achieve them more quickly, or if you are not able to do so you still have to go correct them or start working on other ones.  
  
Life is a journey.  Always knowing where you want to go makes it easier for you to get there.  Otherwise if you start you journey without having a clear path, it would take you longer to get there, or worst, you may never get there.  But if you still do not know what you wand to do, you do not have to worry; they are people who discover what they really want to get out of life when they are adults.  Sometimes things work out for them really nice, and they still have time to enjoy life.
