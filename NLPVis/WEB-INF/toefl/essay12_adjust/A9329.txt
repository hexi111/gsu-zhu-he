The statement justifies that people pay too much attention to their appearance and fashion. I partly agree with statement because one's appearance can affect others' impression and win others' respect. But I don't think it's good to put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, for it may let people to focus on something fake and fading, instead of truthful and lasting.

Someone may argue that appearance can affect people's first impression and win their respect. Sometimes, clothing would represent politeness. That's why people should be aware of their clothing when going to a party or ceremony. The movie "Pretty Woman" is the best example. In the movie, the female character was humiliated by a clerk in a store in Beverly Hills because of her sloppy dressing. Appearance and fashion really matter somewhat. 

Appearance and fashion may be important in some ways, but not in all ways. If people pay too much attention to their appearance or fashion, they may become shallow. Fashion changes all the time, but does it really do good to ourselves? Nowadays, people may spend plenty of money, even get loans to buy fancy clothes or jewels. They aren't all rich so they get more and more debts. What's in one's mind is much more important than what they look like. That's why people should never stop learning new things and searching for knowledge. 

In sum, appearance and fashion may be important to make ourselves look fabulous, but we should keep in mind that they will fade and change soon. Therefore, we should put more emphasis on what lasts forever and conducive, such as knowledge.
