     I disagree with the tendency that people are judged by their appearance and fashion thesedays.

     If the situation to emphasize personal outward appearance continues, it is more likely to lose the real important thing such as good quality for doing a job,
personality, characteristics. People can misunderstand that beauty of appearance is the most important factor to get a new job or make a friend, and it can't be made any improvements with the opinion about appearance. There is an example to show the lesson that we must not judge people by their appearance. There is competent businessman who owns a huge company, but he doesn't care about his appearance. If anyone sees his appearance, they can't notice who the man is. 
When other people, who don't know who the man is, see the rich guy on business, they think that the man is
not such an important person, and they tend to behave in very rude way. Thus, the business man don't want to trade with those people. As a result, people might miss their opportunity to make a profit. 

     Another reason is that it is possible to waste time and money for good appearance. We have to spend time looking over magazines that deal with fashion, shopping for great clothes, and going to hair salon for having nice look. I think that it's not a productive way to manage time. 

     Finally, putting emphasis on appearance makes people dangerous. For instance, a lot of plastic surgeory are performed in my country. According to a survey of psychology, it is associated to death especially, among young women. This problem is becoming social issue.

     To sum up, I don't think that it is a good way.
