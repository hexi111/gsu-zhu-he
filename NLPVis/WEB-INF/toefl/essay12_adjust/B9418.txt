I think planning things carefully is not necessarily the reason that people have a successful life in their future. So, I don't agree to this statement. 

First of all, planning doesn't guarantee what you actually do. For example, you might need to study a few hours for a tomorrow's test. But it happens all the time that you go to a bar with your friends instead of sitting in front of a desk knowing you break the promise that you have just made.

Second, you don't really know what you want to do in the future, what the success is. You might have a broad idea of what you like or dislike, but your perspective is always limited to what you have experienced.  It is too early to decide what is the success in the future logically before having enough experience in various fields. 

Lastly, even a glimpse of TV screen might have a  
potentiality to give you a new perspective what you really want to do.  Your life nowadays is surrounded by a flow of information, and you never know what your element will react to a small piece of new information. The change will happen suddenly and unexpectedly.
