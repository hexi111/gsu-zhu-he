I agree that today people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion and it is all because of the media.

Today society are driven by the media.  When we see a celebrity wearing certain dress or jewelry on TV, everyone be discussing it.  The media tell us what is pretty, what is ugly, and we listen to it.  It tell us what trend is in and what trend is out.

Today society, people are glue to the television.  Majority of the people spend an x amount of hours everyday to watch TV.  Each of us have certain show we love to see.  When we watches these shows, we are pay attention to what the characters doing, saying, and even what are they wearing.  Of course, always, these are not air on TV for entertainment for free.   They are there to selling something to makes money.  Either ideas, fashion, or whatever it is. We recieve these information not knowningly.
