It is not wrong to put a personal appearance and fashion into concern, but I think nowadays people have put too much emphasis on personal appearance.

It is some kind of hard to make new friends if somebody doesnot have a good appearance or fashion. When I went to a party, there is fairly nobody talking to me subjectively. And my friend told me it was because my Asian face. This is an ambarrassing situation for an international student like me. I want to make lots of friends with others, but nobody cares about it. Because people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

The worse thing is that it is also a disadvantage for people     who are seeking jobs. If the first galance of a person is not that good, people will have little chance to win the interview. And this first galance memory is nothing but your personal appearance and maybe fashion.

These two situations may be even worse for girls. There is an old Chinese saying says that if a girl has a good looking, she has everything. Controversely, what if a girl isnot lucky enough but has a bad face? Maybe she has nothing. I am sure this is not fair.

All in all, people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion these days. This may not be a good thing because we want a more fair environment and concentrate more on a person's inside world.
