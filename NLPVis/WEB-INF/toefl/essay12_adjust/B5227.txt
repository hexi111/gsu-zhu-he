I strongly believe that about 90 percents of your future rests on what you pursue during your youth. You will be likely to have a job that is related to what you studied in schools and work with people that you share common interests with. Thus, it is very important to plan carefuly your future because your plans in your youth will have tremendous impacts on your future.

First of all, education in your youth has great influence in your future. You can pursue a variety of education to build up your future. It is not too much to say that what education you had in college determines where you work. Companies are more likely to hire people with college degrees than those without. For your future, you can spend a portion of your lives on going to class, doing homework, and improving your knowledge in order to ensure yourselves better jobs and higher salaries. In addition, it is unlikely that your education obtained after your youth affects your lives. Some elderly people still pursue higher education but their purposes in getting educated at that age are not to gain great knowledge but some minor knowledge.

Second, good relationship with others in your youth will have great influence in your future. In your lives later on, you will have to work with other people that you might not know. You face challenges because they are so different from your best friends and buddies. However, if you meet lots of people with different characterists and personalities and successfully maintain good relationships with them, you will not have much trouble in the future.

So far, I have discussed two important points that can affect your later lives. Education and relationships with others are such important elements that you can acheive in your youth. If you have these two, then you will have brighter futures.
