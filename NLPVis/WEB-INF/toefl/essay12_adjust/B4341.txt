I do strongly believe that it is very important to plan your future. Careful planning and then implementing our long term goals into everyday life allows us to have control over our fate. 
One can accomplish more with a reasonable plan, like saving money for education, learning a language that would be necessary for proffessional advancement or taking prerequisite classess. I strongly believe that we can shape our future by making wise choices and consequently following our goals. My decision about the career change required advance planning and then meticulous execution. I had to make sure that all the prerequisites were met by me and all the steps of the application process were complited in a timely manner.
 
Of course there are always unpredictable events that may make one quit or alter their plans. We also shall not forget about political, historical or economical circumstances that may easily interfere with one's plans for the future. In the past, many of my ancestors were forced to abandon their plans for future mainly due to the wars. As a citizen of a country plagued in the past by numerous wars and political events that would seriously affect one's ability to maintain their lifestyle, household, belongins and eventually - the plans. Sometimes we happen to be subjected to the capricious the fate that may influence our future. A motor vehicle accident, family situation or a serious medical condition may alter or annihilate any plan despite one's determination. Thus the planning should never be rigid. It is recommended that one has an alternative plan in case the unpredictable events happen.  

In my opinion, your future cannot be left vulnerable to purely chance.
