planning is a very important thing, especially for future. because if we are very carefully, we can have more and more chance to win a beautiful life or to go ahead other pople, but how to plan a good future. i believe that we must have a good educational, own a lot of friends and have to open our mind.

Having a good educational, we can save much time than other people We can own huge knowledge to help us to thinking and to decide difficult things especially  when we face a secious problem. what's a good educational, it's not means we need to get a high educational. we have to learning  experiences from our school. for example, we have to built our thinking always on the right ways even not really on the right ways we cann't to hurt somebody when we decided any things. if we hurt somebody's mind because of our decices, we will regart all the time in our life. So it will not makes to own a good future. 

Frineds, we living in a communaty nowadays. we need to own a lot of frineds to help us to face any kind of problems, especailly to own some of close frineds. For example, when i studied in high school, i met a serious problem about my family. My mom got a seriously scik, even we went to see a lot of doctures but at last we were fair. My mom was past away. In my mind, why is it unfair, because i think my mom is a good person. in that time my close tried  to correct my thinking. she said not because of yoyr monther was a bad person, your monther to got sick that it was by natural not your fault or your mom's fault. 

In conclusion, i think beforre we do any think we have to plan all of the things, because i have to say, i learning a lot of  experiences from my friends and my teachers. So do a plan can own a good future.
