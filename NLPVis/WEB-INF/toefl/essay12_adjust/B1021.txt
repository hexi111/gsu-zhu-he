In today's society, young people begin to plan their future earlier and earlier. Sometimes, their parents will them to make some careful plans for them as well. Some people think it is necessary to plan one's future as early as possible, while others argue that young people should enjoy their lives in this very time and not think about future too early. In my opinion, I think it will be very helpful to make careful plans for our future lives. The reasons are shown below.

First, a careful plan for one's future will tell him/her what they should prepare for the future. With the plan, people are able to clearly understand the direction of their work. According to the plan, people can schedule their time better for working for their future. 

Secondly, the plan will help people to know what kinds of skill and knowledge they need to aquire when they are young for realizing their future dreams. For example, a person who wants to become a designer will tend to aquire the best drawing skill for his/her future career.

Nevertheless, even though carefully making a plan for one's furture is helpful, the time of making this plan should not be too early. For instance, many children lost their happy childhood because they have to learn many skills to ensure their good future according to the 'careful' plan'; also, if making a plan too early, it is highly possilbe that this person encouter some difficulties when they find they changed their interests after they grown up.

In conclusion, carefully planing for your future is the best way to ensure a good future only if you make this plan at the appropriate time and understand that you should properly use and adjust it when needed. Thus, I agree that making a careful plan at a proper time is a great way to help one' future.
