This is trure that people care more about their personal appearence and fashion than their actual personality nowadays. It is because a person's appearence tells a lot about his or her characteristic. but a person's characteristic and taste cannot be told just from his or first appearence. A person cannot and should not be judged by only his or her appearence rather than by personal characteristics.

When judging a person, it is very wrong to evaluate that person by only his or her external appearence. No matter how smartly someone is dressed or how fashionable he or she is, if that person doesn't have a good characteristic he or she can't be liked by everyone.
For example, if a girl wants to judge a boy on their first date, she can't judge him by only looking how well he is dressed and how latest model of car he is driving. If she wants to judge him well, she has to look inside him for his real character.  The girl may get flattered when she sees the boy coming in a BMW car with a costly gift, but  after a while she realizes that the boy is a not good person so she leaves him.

So, appearence and fashion are not the keys to judge  a person.
