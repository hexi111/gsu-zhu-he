Agree:

DO you think the right time to plan for your future is while you are young or not? People that plan for there future when they are young live a good life than those which did not even thought about their futerwhen they are young.

A good future depends on how we think when we are young. when we say planning for our feuture we have to think about our education,how to earn and spend money,how many kids we are gone have, what kind of house we are gone have, some other things that we need for our life. When we plan we save some money for our future so that we have enough for our needs for the future. When we are young we are able to move around almost every where we went and work what ever we like to work. For example, I used to work two jobs for almost two years to save some money so that I can go back to scool I worked two jobs because I am young otherwise I would not have been able to do because I would not be able to ,the older we get the less our ability to do things will be. On the ohter hand, if we educate our self when we are young we are gone earn a good money so that we can save money for our retirment and for our kids so that they can go to a college and live a better life.

In conclusion, planning for our future while we are young is good so that we live a better life in the future and also not a burden on some body else and on the country we live in too.
