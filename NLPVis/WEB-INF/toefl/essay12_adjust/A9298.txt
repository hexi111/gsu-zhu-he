I don't agree with the idea that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
 
Of course, it is true that is too much and sometimes it occurs  economical or mental issues in ourselves. However, I think it is a part of a culture and we should follow it.
 
For the first, we can emphasis on our appearance in order to manage myself well. For example, it is better that we go on a shopping than watching television at home while we have free time. Because, we can catch up with recent fashion trend  and it can be some exercise at the same time. So it is good for both of physical health and psychological health.  
 
For the next, we can get away from getting stress. Nowadays, there are so many stressful things going on in our lives. In order to get rid of those stress, we would better    concentrate on our appearance. At least,  we can forget about other stressful things while we follow the beauty of stylish fashion.
 
Finally, we are living in deferent generation from the past. We have variety in fashion, food, trend and culture. If we do not have certain financial problem, I think we can enjoy our life through spending time and money on our appearance and fashion to have better quality of life.
 
Overall, I don't agree with that idea.
