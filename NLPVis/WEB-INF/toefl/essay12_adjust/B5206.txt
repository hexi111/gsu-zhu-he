dreams and goals are very important, every person need some goals which he/she wants to achieve. 

if you are young your goals are going to change a lot as well as your interests and your preferences are going to change. but still it is important to have a certain plan which will help you to ensure a good futur. you should think about your futur all the time, just to get to know yourself better. so if you have some dreams or goals which you want to achieve you have to be sure how you are going to achieve them, and also what you need to get there. A plan is going to help you staying on the right path and also gives you a certain direction, so that you are not going to "walk in a circle". if you fallow this plan and you are sure to be on the right way, your are going to achieve your goals for sure, but of course you have to work hard and never stop working on it, because achieving goals need a lot of work which you have to do. but together with a plan it makes it a lot easier and gives you a good control over what you have done and what you still need to do!

but there is one important thing which you don't have to forget. also if you work with a plan, don't forget to live. the plan should not determine your life, it should just be an aid.
