When asked about the people's emphasis on personal appearance and fashion a quick answer comes to mind, and that is absolutely. 

First of all, marketing plays a big role in our lives. When we watch television, look at magazines, or even when we go to the movies we are generally bombarded with ads from different companies whose sole interest is for us to buy their products. Many of the ads generally show nice looking models and they sell us an idea that if we look good then we will be accepted by society in general. 

Another reason that supports my position is that by taking care of your personal appearance you will be more likely to have more friends. People that look well and have a nice appearance usually will not have a hard time relating to other people, on the contrary people that don't pay attention to their overall appearance are usually outcast. 

Finally, one of the main reasons appearance and fashion play a big role on many people is that kids are being programmed with that idea once they start watching the programs that are available on most television programs. An example of a program that teaches young girls about the importance of appearance and fashion are the brats and most shows on the Disney channel.

I believe that society has accepted the whole notion that if you dress well and if you look like a model, you are a succesful individual, some of there factors that support this position include marketing, popularity and television shows, this leads me to believe that there is too much emphasis placed on personal appearance and fashion.
