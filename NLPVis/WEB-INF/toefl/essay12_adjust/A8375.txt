I agree that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. However, it is inevitable. Because of  the rising of design textile industry, many cloth and cosmetic manufactures are keen to promote their product. Besides that, I thought the concept of fashion and art were delivered to products by this way. 

We can not deny that our daily life is arrounded by advertisements. And there are models and movie stars in these advertisements. So people would like to try to make themself look like as fashion as a model. However, it is nothing wrong to become beauty but people may spend too much time and money on that. Some times people get hurts form this. For example, some young girls want to as thin as fashion models. Then they try to loss weight by aggresive ways and damage their health. Thats not worth, because health is beyond fashion.

More over, people like to compare each other in buying some brand. For example, some expensive should bag costs hundreds dollars but many young people want to buy it just because some movie satrs have one. However, they must put too much attentions on this instead of thier school and books. Therefore, it becomes a problem when people put too much  emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

In conclusion, it is a natural that people try to improve themself. Once they focus on their appearence too much, they may lost their true value. It is just a kind of copy version.
