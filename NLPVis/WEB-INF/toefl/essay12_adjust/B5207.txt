There are many ways to ensure a good furture for ourselves, but the best way to do so is to plan carefully while we are still young. That is because we can find our aptitude by trial and errors and chances to succeed in their life.

To begin with, by trial and errors in youth, we are able to know our aptitude. That is to say, when people are young, they do not know their ability exactly. So it is very hard to decide their aptitude and future. From my personal experience, when I was young, I was interested in and good at math. Even though I was excellent at math, my parents tried to teach the other subject, English, to me. They thought that sometimes children's aptitude would change. Due to their careful preparation, I could be English teachers. 

In addition, people can have an opportunity to succeed when they are young if they plan to their future meticulously. That is, if parents or teachers find their children or students' talent earlier, their children and students are likely to succeed in their future. For example, one prodigy is good at playing the viloin. Whether he/ she is successful or not is depending on careful plan. If his/ her parents prepare for the future thoroughly, he/ she will have a chance to succeed. However, his/ her parents do not plan efficiently, he/ she will become common people. From this perspective, it is very momentous for children's parents to plan for their children's future while children are young.

To sum up, the best way to ensure a splendid future for people is to plan carefully while they are young. That is because they can find their aptitude by trial and errors and have an opportunity to succeed in their field. When people are young, if they show their aptitude and talent, people are likely to succeed in their life.
