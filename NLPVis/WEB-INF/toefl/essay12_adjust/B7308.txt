I agree with this statement. People should plan their future when they are young and as early as possible. It is said that " early bird will never get hungry." be prepare, and then word for your successful future. 

I came to the U.S. one year before. I was in Taiwan for the past 18 years. My parents send me here is hoping that I can have a better future, no doubt. Parents always want to have children who are successful in their future.     

I, as a student in the college right now, have no idea whay I want to do for the future, which is kind of wrong. As i said before, it is better to plan our future as earlier as possible. Although I am just a freshman, I do not have much time left for graduate, I have to prepare for my future, or more specific, career. I have not decide my major, which is not recommended. If people can decide their major as early as possible, then it is more easier to prepare their future. They at least got an idea what the direction is for the future. 

it is said that " Success is build from one percent of talent with ninty-nine percent of hard work." If we can plan our future carefully when we were young, the ndon't we can have more time to workd on our plan? As more hard work we have done for future, the more successful future is deserved . 

People always had the choice to make their life, if we can plan our life as early as possible, then we will have more time to develop the better future.
