The saying goes that "he who fails to plan, plans to fail".
There is another saying that young people should "make hay while the sun shines". I strongly agree that the best way to ensure a good future for one's self is to plan carefully when one is young. 

Every young person must have aspirations; educational, occupational, marital as well as retirement aspirations. The period of adolescence is when young people need to be proactive and think about what they want to be in future, how much education is needed to get to where they want, the kind of person they like to marry, and, how they wish to spend their retiment years.

I beleive that these aspirations and careful plannings will guide young people in other steps they might take. For example, a young boy who desires to be a medical doctor will know for sure that college education is undebateable. keeping this goal in mind will also prevent such youngster from non-normative or delinquent behaviors that counld hinder him from achieving his goals. In other words, aspirations and goals for the future promote acdemic resilience in young people.

Also, I believe that when young people plan ahead of time, especially they are young will not only keep them focus on the goal, but, will also enable them to make the best use of opportunities that might come their ways. For example, an African child who plans to be a lawyer will not refuse the opportunity to work as an office assitant to a local lawyer or magistrate. This is because, taking up such a job will give him/her the opportunity to be exposed to trainnings and experiences in the legal field. Such experiences might be very helpful in his/her future career as a lawyer.
