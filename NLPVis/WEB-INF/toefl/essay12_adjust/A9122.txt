     Appearance has been regarded important, is important, and will be important. Appearance doesn't mean just lexury clothes and ear-rings. it shows how he/she is interested in his/her own body and how much loves themselves.

    That is usually used to judge the person's habit and attitudes. If someone wears stained jean instead of wearing  clean suit at presentation or important meeting, good result is not expected. Recent research shows that more than half interviewers have been affected by interviewees' appearance.

     Without prior information appearance is the only way to assess the persons. So, this influences first impression much, and this is why most people assume that apppearance will be also important in the future.
