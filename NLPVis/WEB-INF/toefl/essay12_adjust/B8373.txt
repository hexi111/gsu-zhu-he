starting to plan your future when you are young is a good idea to gain success later, but it's not necessary to be the best option. Many people cannot decide what they really want to do or what they really like at young age, so it may take long time for them to reach the tract to success. Thus, I don't agree the statement that it is the best way to ensure a good future to plan carefully when you are young for following 3 reasons.
 
First at all, how long to plan for your future is not as critical as how to reach a plan to ensure your future. A careful created plan is based on a clearly understood goal that you see to lead to a good future. Many young people cannot find what they really like to do for a life long goal; most of them try to have many experieces over different studies at school, different jobs after school. Finally, they can have the best option for them which they are most familiar and most interested in, and then most people are already in their later twenties or even in their thirties. However, it's never late to change your carrier to challege something new, which can be the right way for you to gain the sucess.

second, when you are young, you are not so knowlegable to plan your future. you may only make the decision based on something in trend then, but it may not be practical, or the trend just come and go, then you have to make another plan again. therefore, plan early is not necessary to the best way to sucess.

In conclusion, planning your life is based on the knowlege and experience you have , not on the age or how long you start the plan.
