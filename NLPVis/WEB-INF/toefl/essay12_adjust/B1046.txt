Planning is an essential component in determining one's future. Definitely  planning our future when we are young would definitely ensure a better carrer.

When we are young, we are unaware of the oppurtunities that lay infront of us. Its mostly our parents decision that we follow. Parents can be our guide who can help us identify our talents and pursue those strong points. Parents can help us plan our future based on the current goals. With a future plan set early, we have time to achieve the goals; as we have more time to prepare for the task. In attaining a better future, we may fail many a times, but we would still have enough time to achive the goal.  

Planning early definitely ensures a better future, but it would not let us explore all the fields that one experience with time. With time we may find more areas of interest and maybe we enjoy working in that area. 

Thus, Planning early would definitely help us in ensuring a good future. But we might still be leaving certain areas in life that we should have explored. The safe bet is to attain a good future and have it as a backup and then start working upon the new dimensions in life, just to make sure that we are not leaving on something.

As everything has its pros and cons, even planning early may cause some trouble at times. It might be that our guide who would help us in planning a better future cannot identify our strong skills and lead us into another direction. The result would be that we would be working in a field that we do not have a genuine interest. Although, the possibility of this scenario is weak, as mostly the guides are parents. Its a risk worth taking for ensuring a better future. Thus, based on the above mentioned arguments we can very well say that planning young is the best way to ensure a good future.
