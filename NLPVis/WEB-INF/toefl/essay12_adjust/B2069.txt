Today is not what tomorrow will be and tomorrow is not what today is. That is the whole problem of planning while you are still very young. The world is very dynamic. There is so much change going around the world. Ten years ago, we used to use Windows 95 and listen to music through a tape recorder. In this decade, we had many versions of Windows (98, Me, 2000, XP, Vista) and now we listen music through iPods and compact discs. The favourite search engine is Google. Everybody atleast has a broadband connection at home in USA. Who would have predicted this. It is because of this that it is important we remain flexible about our life. 

On the other hand, if you observe the successfull and the unsuccessful people around you, it will be seen that the main difference is that the successful people had a plan with their life and followed it. The important thing I guess was that, although plans call for rigidity, they were flexible enough, so that they modified their plan, according to every new situation that arose that disrupted their plans. For example, a guy may have planned to have become a programmer in his life. When he started school, the programming language used mainly was COBOL, and hence he learned it. Then it became C/C++ and then Java today. This person did not retire or change his job with every change in programming language, instead he learned the new languages and started working with them. 

Hence, I would like to conclude by agreeing with the statement that to  ensure a good future for yourself, it is better to plan carefully, while your are still young. But make sure the plan is a flexible.
