Some people believe that young people have more opptunity to become rich in the furture so they do not need to care too much about their money. However, other people may have oppsite opinion about this. they think people should plan carefully on spending their money from young age. In my point of view, I agree with the second group of people. People should carefully spending their money in order to have a good future.

First of all, spending money carefully can help people to have a good habit on saving money and learn how to efficient to use their money for the most important thing. For example, many children get a certain mount of money from their parents. If they just spend money on playing or buying food, consequently, they will have a bad habit. They will not know making money is so difficult. Even worse, they will not well prepare for their furture job because they think it is not hard at all to find a well-paid job.

What is more, People should save their money for their furture usage. As we all know, people cannot predict what will happen tomorrow. Therefore, the wise decision is planing their money carefully. People can use their saving buying a big house at a low price for investment. As the price rising, they can sell and make money. Besides, people also can use their money for immegence. If people suddenly have a bad luck and lose their job, they can use their saving to survive and allow them take time to find another job. These may benifit their furture.

In conclusion, I believe people should planing their money carefully when they are still young, so they can have more chance to have a good future and success later.
