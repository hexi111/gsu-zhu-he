Admittedly, planting a goal when you are young will definitely gives you a driving force to pursue your dream.However, in fact, the the plan you did when you are still young cannot be the one which really suitable for you in the future. Personally ,I disagree the opinion in the title that"the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young."

The young have not fully developed yet, so the plan they have is not sensible and feasible for them in most cases. As young, they have not experience enongh as an adult, so they don't have the ability to determine what their future are. 

As young, they always change their ideal frequently. For example, when I was 6 years old , I wanted to be scientist. When I was 8, after a movie about fireman, I wanted to be fireman. So the plan you made when you are too young absolutly does not make any sense.

The best time to plan you future carefully is the time when you got some experience from the society and got some knowledge from the school.From then on, the plan you made could be the driving force in your life.

Ensuring your future is pretty signficant for your whole life so that we cannot do it too early.
