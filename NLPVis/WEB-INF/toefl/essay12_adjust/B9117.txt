When we are young, we all have our dream. We will think what we want to be in the future, doctor, nurse, engineer, or other occupation. If you have the dream, you should have a detailed planning, especially in the young or growing stage.

If you wanted to be a professional, you would plan your path much early. For example, if you wanted to be doctor, you would take some science subjects in your high school, then chose medical school in the university. If you didn't plan it carefully, you may not have much choices. It is because everything has its own restrictions and rules. If you fail to fulfill those requirments, you can't be easier to get into it. oreover, you will waste much time without  planning. You can complete your goal, however, you will  consumer much longer time than others. 

Besides, under the higly competitive society, you may lose your competitive power compared with the same age. For example, if you became the doctore later than others, you will have less experience than others too. You need to strive harder to find jobs, or even some related experience.

Although having a good planning is essential to the future, there are a lot of unseenable factors affecting the planning such as economic factors, policy and so on. All these factors will affect your planning, it will make you get frustration or even side track. You need to put much confidence and emphasize on your plan to elminiate those factors to follow your plan. I believe have a good planning in your young stage is important to your future.
