I agree with the idea that the best way to ensure a good future for myself ts to plan carefully while I am still young.
 
Because, time is the most precious than money and we never can find the time if it is already past.
 
First of all, we are healthier while we are young so it is better to make enough experiences before we get older.
 
When we are young, we have more energy and we can think faster. Even though we fail at something we have planed, we still have energy to process the next step. 
 
Secondly, we can make more friends when we are young.
With making various friends, we can figure out what kind of job or life style is suitable for myself. At the same time, we can make plan for future little by little and shape our life in a long run.
 
For the last, we will not regret about our life in young ages when we look back after became old. It is never good to regret about anything. If we already have tried many things with trial and error, we will not regret  about time consuming during our young age, unless. 
 
Therefore, I agree with this idea.
