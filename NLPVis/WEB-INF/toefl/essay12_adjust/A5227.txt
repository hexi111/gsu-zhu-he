Yes they do gosh!!!!!

Nowadays, in the world, highly developed on various transportation and networks, we live in an era of globalization. It is very common that a person from a country travels to another, and even migration is no longer considered unorthodox. Such changes have brought about tremendous effects on our lives and also our aspects on fashion change. We stand in front of the mirror for a big portion of our time to see what suits us the most: whether the fashion has its root in France, in Spain, Asian countries, or even in Africa. We no longer consider clothing and make-up for just wears, but they have become our personalities.

First, people's aspects on fashion-related goods changed tremendously. For example, in the sixties or fifties, mainly taylors and professionals made fashionable clothes. This took both the consumer and the producer a long time so clothes-shopping was not so much of hobbies. suits were good an example. Now, we have factories that manufacture a great number of clothes in a split-second that consumers can look around and pick according to their taste. In addition, make-up goods were worn for big events and ceremonies such as marriage and festivals in the past. Since make-up is employed in order to change the facial look, it used to give impression that make-up creates misleading looks of a person. However, any one uses make-up nowadays for different purposes such as to disguise their pimples on the faces, for just better looks, or even to differ their looks.

In short, as the world changes very fast, people's ideas and perceptions on fashion also becomes impacted by such changes. Clothes are no longer some things used just to cover up their bodies but means to express themselves. Also we commonly use make-up to morph ourselves.
