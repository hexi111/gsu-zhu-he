I agree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future is to plan for it well in advance. Financial stability, a good education and a carefree retirement are some examples of the benefits of prudently planning ahead in life.

In order to be financially stable it is essential to make regular savings. One should also try their hand at investment options when one is young. To buy a house or vehicle, save for children's education we need to make savings on a day-to-day basis. Here planning comes into play.  

The foundation of a successful professional career is good education. Funding for higher education needs to be planned. Many courses that we take in school shape our understanding of the area in which we would like to specialize. Here too planning can play an important role.

The importance of retirement savings cannot be stressed enough. Empty nesters who do not have the physical ability anymore to work require a nest egg that will allow them to enjoy this golden period in their life. However, planning needs to begin in youth. 

In conclusion, planning is required to lead a satisfying and successful life. Circumstances are known to change the course of lives no matter how much we plan ahead of time. But it is not a good idea to give our lives upto chance and fate. It is necessary to proactively plan for a bright future for ourselves and our loved ones.
