I am not totally agree, the statement seams very clear and straight forward because that is what we have been thought.
And if you have the opportunity to do it could be very nice.

But I am not agree because I see many people living today in a rush, with excess of work and sacrificing every thing for the future. And my philosophy is leave today and plan as much as you can for the tomorrow...in case you get there.

One example is I was planning to do my master as soon as I finish college but I did not began until four years latter because I began to work. I was trying to find the opportunity to study a PhD after the master, but the opportunity did not came until six years latter I finish my master, but it gives me the opportunity to teach in two universities. 

So we can make plans for our life, but we need to take the chances and the opportunities that life bring to us every day and make the best with those resources.

Maybe because I am much older than my classmates I see the life in different way. For me the classes are very important, the grades not so much. I prefer to spend time meeting persons building up my network than get and excellent grade. Sometimes you can have both, but if not I prefer to spend time with my friends, colleges, family and enjoy my life as much as I can.

For me is surprising how the Americans save money to travel when they retired, I travel as much as I can now that I have the health and the strength to do it. 

Tomorrow, the future is a fiction, that could come a reality and we need to plan for those days, yes. I have two plans of retirement just in case. I know I will have enought  to live and I will try to save more to have a pleasure future...but I will not sacrifice the today for the tomorrow.
