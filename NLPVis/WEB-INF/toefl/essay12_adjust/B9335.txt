Everybody wants a good future, a good job, great family, and lots and lots of money. For most people, all those things don't come out of the blue. To achieve those things a lot of work must be done before hand. We must start planning to achieve those things when we are young. 

The first part to achieving a good future is a good education. All jobs require some sort of education. In some jobs a person may just need basic math and language skills, but other jobs require a person to have more complex skills. These skills are only attainable through education.

Education should come while a person is still young. A young person still has a lot of energy but not a lot of skills. A young person is usually not burdened by family, or any other matters of the world. A young person can concentrate. Once a person gets to an older age, it is considerably harder for him or her to try to learn something new, the old brain cells does not take new information easily, furthermore concentration is needed, and older people may have other obligations that they must meet. Thus it is a good idea for somebody who is still young to plan for his future by simply educating him or herself.

Another reason to start early is that work requires both energy and time. To rise to the top, one must start at the bottom. A person may have to work hard for years and years before achieving a good position at his or her current job. A young person has time to rise to the top, an older person may run out of time. He may have to retire before getting to a position that is worthy of his talent. A young person also has more energy which is usually needed to work harder. An older person tires more.

All those reasons suggest that it is better for people to start planning for their future while they are young. People who do will have more chances of success, and a better future than people who start later in life.
