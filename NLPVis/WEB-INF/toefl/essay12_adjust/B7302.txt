Did you planned your future?   

Planning a future is not thst essy. No one knows what they want or want until they really think about it and disid for their self. Howerver, having your future planed while you are sill young is the right thing to do, that is what i support and believ in. 

Not having your future planned is not that big of a deal. People dont realize that  it is important untell they hit a surtant age, verey old age, an dregret it. I believe that the good way of planning a futurer is when being young becuse that gives time to think while growing up and will give more time to change thought and dissesions.

For example, college studeny in their freshman year some of them know what they want  and had drwon their future before attending the university. Other students are having troble with disiding what magior to do and study, therefor, they are forced to have more extend years in the university, cusing them to fall back in years of graduation,cuesing them more dificulties in finding a job. forinstance, in my country students who graduate in four years or less they have  more job oppertonity mor then those who graduate in five or six years. It is much eassy to have your future planned.

Inconclousion, planning your future ahaed of time is the best way to in sure a succesfull future.
