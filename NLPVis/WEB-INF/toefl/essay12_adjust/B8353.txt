People always say that we should enjoy everthing that we can do while we still young. That is what I believe. When we are old we can not do anything much, such as go travel the world and hinking on the mountains because we may not have enough energy to do those kind of things when we are 70s or 80s. Therefore, we should plan what we can do while we are still young.

We should plan to do something that we might not do when we are old. When we are getting old, our body might not be active such as old people might be tire when only walk 10 minunts.
