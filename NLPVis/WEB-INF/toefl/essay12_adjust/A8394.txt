Appearant is a very important minior in world especially for nowadays communicaty. wedon't have enough time to know each other so we just according to  our appearance to own a good impression and much easier to make friends. 

In 21st, all of the things change very fast and quickly. It makes us to thinking that our appearant is very important to us because everyone wants to show their perfect part to other people. For example, in the interview, we want to do our best and show our profesional ability to company in the liminted time. in this cause appearance much more important than usually time because we need to wear approptiate clothes and bring our smiling show everybody. It be able to help to us to get job and to give other people a good impression even this interview i maybe fail but i already do my best one. i think it can help me in the future. 

Nowadays, we have to meet some of stranger people, we don't know all of strangers are nice or not so maybe we can disgusting from their appearant. i know maybe it will not very suit for some specially situations but have a good appearant can help us to defind a good one. By the way, we still have to very carefully, because i know have some people wear very appreciate clothes tying to cheat nice guy. i suggest we can't only to see stranger's appearance but also we have to listen their speaking and mind.

In clousion, some people say have a good appearance is very important, i agree this thiking because give other people a good imression but just only on the first sight. I want to mention, try to listen their mind and built our brain  are most imortant things
