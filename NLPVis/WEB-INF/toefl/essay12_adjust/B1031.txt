There are a lot of people in forties and fifties today that regret their lives because they did not plan what they would do in their future. Thus, they cannot have a good life today, and they have to face with a lot of financial problems everyday. In general, planning carefully in highschool is the best way to ensure a good future for people because they can figure out what major they like and have enough time to take care of their major.

Studing in highschool is the best way for student to plan what major they want to study because they have been learning in many different subjects. For example, a student, whose dream is being a doctor, but she likes to study History and Political Science better than Maths and Biology in highschool. Then, she can decide to change her dream and study hard in Political Major in a college. Therefore, people should plan their future while they are still young in order to have a good future.

Moreover, when people figure out what major they like as they are young, they have time to take care of what they need to do in order to achieve or succeed in the future.

It will help her to save her time in college than if she does plan her major before.
