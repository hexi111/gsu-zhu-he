Yes, for a person to achieve greater success in life he or she has to plan carefully about their future goals and priorities at an early age. This is an era of cut throat competition with only the fittest and smartest being the survivor. In order to handle fierce competition and succeed in life, young people need to start sooner.

We are aware of plenty of success stories of the people who started early, at a realatively young age, as compared to their peers. Like the co-founders of Google who started their own company when the rest of their peers were sitting in graduate school attending classes. Same is true for worlds richest man, Bill Gates, who ventured into the software business earlier than the others.

Its not only that people have to start early but they have to envision and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. This rapidly changing global environment is so fluid that oppurtunities have to be latched on instantly. And the plans need to be executed at the same rapid pace, as the time window to execute our plans is getting shorter. So apart from carefully planning their future younger generations should also execute their plans in a timely fashion in order to achieve their goals.

Technology has advanced at such a tremendous rate that a teenagers today not only has to cope with the humongous history, but also keep pace with the rapidly changing environment, which can affect their future tremendously. The only solution for a person to survive in this competitive era and be more successful is by starting out early. As that gives individual ample time to  make amends if things do not go as planned. If plans are executed on time individual will have that one step ahead in race just because of starting early. Hence for a better and a brighter future kids today need to start planning early at a much younger age.
