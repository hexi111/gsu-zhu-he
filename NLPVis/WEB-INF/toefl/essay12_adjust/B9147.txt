In this paper, I will discuss whether or not planning carefully is important while we are still young to ensure a good future for ourselves. I will shed light on my own experiences as arguing that planning is a necessary factor to maintain a good life.

Young people are likely to live without considering their own future. They usually disregard the fact that they need to make something or to lay a ground for their own future. Since, we, young people, want to have fun and live ourlives as we want. However, when we grow up and reach to certain ages or after finishing colleges, we could find ourselves in a situation that is not as satisfactory as we hope. Then, we could begin to think what was wrong. The passed times without planning is likely to be one of the reasons of our dissatisfaction. In this regard, I emphasize the importance of planning, especially in the college years, to reach our aims and to live our whole life as we want. 

In my highschool years, I was living without considering tomorrow and doing something if I want. In my last year in highschool, I wanted to go to Istanbul and study there. Then, this aim pushed me to study and I entered one of the good universities in my country. Although, I became successful as living in a way that I wanted, in my prep class, I failed and I understood the importance of planning. Things that I am supposed to do were more, so I had to plan my life to do all things that I want. Actually, this notion of planning is related to what we want. If we want to be successful and to realize what we want in our lives, planning should be in the center of ourlives.

In sum, planning carefully is required to ensure a good life. We could reach a life that we want as planning ourselves. As a last point, it could be stated that the more things we want to do, the more we need planning.
