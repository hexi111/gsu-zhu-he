Plastic surgery, diet, gym... these things are getting more popular than decades ago. People seem to put too much emphasis on their personal appearance and fashion. 

This reminded me of the movie "The Devil Wears Prada", which won this year's Oscar award. Many girls recommended this movie to me "because the clothes in the movie are just so fashionable!". I watched the movie: those girls working in the fashion magazine office do not eat properly just to fit themselves into those high-end-brands clothes; to wear gorgeous clothes seemed to be more important than work ability. Well, if that is what people are pursuing nowadays, I would say that is sad, and they are definitely putting too much emphasis on personal appearance. 

Balanced diet, regular exercise, and appropriate dress-to-situations, in my opinion, are enough to my definition of fashion. Excessive emphasis on physical appearance is not necessary and can affect your personal life. For example, some women avoid eating to lose weight and look skinny, there are quite a lot of women died because of eating disorders. 

There is a rise in participation of regular exercise judging from my personal experience. I always see a lot of people whenever I go to gym. This is a correct way to improve personal appearance and I cannot agree no more. 

From people I know, there are not so many extreme cases who did too much for fashion. So I believe nowadays, there are some people who put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion, yet most of the people are just placing the right amount of emphasis on appearance and fahsion.
