With the development of press and media industry, people pay more attention on their appearance and fashion than before. In my opinion, it is good for economy.
      
First, the emphasis is good for economy. When people start to pay attention on their physical appearance, they may invest more money on clothing and decoration. The investment may stimulate economy positively. The emphasis fastens consumption, then fastens production, then varied products stimulate the emphasis. This fast running circle is a so good stimulation for economy that no one need to worry about inflation. 
      
Second, the emphasis may make the world more beautiful  than before. If everyone care  the environment where they live, they may protect it. No wastes will be dumped to water, no harmful gas will be pulled out.
      
Third, if people emphasis on their people appearance, they may willing to read many books, because books can decorate people's mind.
      
Though emphasis on personal appearance may have some negative effects, e,g, wast time and money on decoration and making up, its advantages are far more than advantages
