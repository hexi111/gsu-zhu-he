I don't think nowadays people put too much emphasis on appearance and fashion.  Admittedly, people now pay more attention on their appearance than before. This doesn't mean they are wasting time but show that people are more polite and considerate than they used to be.

Each person wants to demostrate his or her best appearence to the public. No people want to be stand in public with ugly look and semlly odor. This tradition can be dated from long time ago since people can make clothes for themselves not only for warm but also for beauty. Someone has the misunderstanding that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance because with mass communication especially Internet, people can get bunch of fashion information quickly. And nowadays people are tend to try new things often. So when they got so much latest fashion information, people changed their appearance freqently and in different style. Like for girls, they tend to follow their favorite movie star or singer easily from fashion magazine or entertainment news. So today they may do make-up like Jennifer Lopes while dress like Brittany this month but next month they like Jessica Alba's taste more so they just copy her make up or dressing style. They are just want to make themselves look attractive, just because a lot of fashion information available to them so they change a lot on their fashion styles.

Today, people are encouraged to keep updated with all aspects definitely including fashion.
