It is obvious that preparing and orgarnizing oneself in a efficient fashion will increase a probability of a good future. Yet, an underlying assumption of this idea is that one has necessary and sufficient capacities to oraginze future in accordance with one's interests. Thus,  it appears to be relatively demanding for young children to perepare themselves efficiently. 

I think, in so far as yound children is concerned, it is important to gain a wider range of experience. For instance, if a child wants to be a professor, then it is not surpsring that he must devote himself to studying mathmatics. 

Another example is related to professional knowledge of a certain field. For example, John wants to become a car mechanic. Then, it does not make sense to plan is career "carefully" without how cars work.  

Taking together, young people can have better ability to plan their future more successfully, only if they have necessary and sufficient knowledge of their interests. Although planning a goal carefully is a good habit to have, a good future of young children may stem from a wider range of experience and sufficient knowledge of their interests.
