I agree with the statement that people nowadays put too much emphasis on their personal appearance and fashion especially for people with higher-economic status. 

For example, a person who dressed nicely, wearing a blouse that match with the color of their shoes and handbag will give the image of a person with high-taste of choice which is usually associated with high socio-economic status, for instance, a corporate woman. 

On the contrary, a person who wears jeans and T-shirt can be interpreted as an on-going person, a person who can easily socialize with other people or a person of a lower socio-economic status, for example, a student who usually does not have enough money to buy expensive, branded outfits.

In my personal opinion, it is very important for a person to care about his or her personal appearance because their personal appearance is always be interpreted as their identity and image that is always be associated with their attitudes and behaviors. 

However I also believe that taking care of your appearance does not mean that you need to be too fanatic about fashion. You can show positive image just by dressing appropriately without really spending too much money for branded dress and fashion-oriented type of outfits.
