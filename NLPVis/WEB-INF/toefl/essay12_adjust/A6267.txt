I cannot totally agree the argument that people are paying too much attention to their apperance.

Nowadays people are more oftenly paticipate in social events such as party, conference or sport than the past times. It is important for one person to dress neatly and properly when he or she want to appear as a comfortable man or woman to others in the meeting. We natually regard one person who is tidy and clean as a trustable person. Furthermore, we are reluctant to communicate with one that looks dirty or nasty. Because man is born to love beauty. Man is supposed to be in good shape. Otherwise he will not be accepted by the public.

Well dressing can also bring confidence to people. Many women spend hours and dollars in purchasing redearth and lipsmacks, which seems a waste of time and money to most people, even those women themselves. But those women are full of spirits after dressing. The wringkles on their faces show that it is worthwhile to pay close attention to their apperance. The self-image is successfuly built after using some kinds of unusually lipsmacks. Therefore, man are really benefit from the good dressing spiritually.

While someone are so sensive about their appearance that they almost devote their whole life to the dressing. Fashion is not bad, but people are not supposed to live for the comments and views from others. It is also of great importance to learn how to built our confidence from some other apporaches. 

It is never wrong to be a beauty, but there are something more important than the appearance.
