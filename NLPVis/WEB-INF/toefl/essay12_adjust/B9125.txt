     The statement claims: "The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young." Although it is possible to picture a few benefitial instances given by this statement, I cannot fully agree with this statement. 

     First, it is impossible to plan carefully when a person is young. A person's maturity develops through tremendous amount of experiences in life. As the person experience, the person's viewpoint is always affected at the various levels, and it keeps changing throughout the life. Therefore, it is impossible to choose a certain period in life to plan well for the future. 

     Second, even if it would be possible to plan the future and to follow the plan at one's best, it may limit person's opportunities which may lead him/her to experience various events available. For instance, one person could plan to become an engineer and s/he had eliminated anything which is not directly related to engineering. This will hinder the development of various talents which s/he could potentially have. By having a plan, one may not try to accept other opportunities in the world - which does not lead to "a good future" in most of the cases.

     Third, I fear that the idea of to live as it is planned may cause the person to have a restricted view point. Having a carefully illustrated plan and living as the plan, one may encounter difficulties in accepting the variety of thoughts or ideas, which may not always fit in the "plan." It is hardly possible to achieve a "good future," when a person cannot accept varieties in ideas.

     Although I acknowledge that the the notion of planning life and live as the plan may make the person to feel secured in a sense, it may not be the best solution for the "good future" for everyone. Furthermore, it may provide some negative impacts on one person's life as illustrated above. Therefore, I cannot agree with the current statement.
