I always think my knowledge in finance because it is not enough to find a good job in the future.  Thus, I believe I would find good job if I never give up my subject.  According to these way to follow.

I would study hard on my majer in finance at Pace University.  Pace University has lots of classes in investment management.  Then, I think which would help me to expend my knowledge in finance.
