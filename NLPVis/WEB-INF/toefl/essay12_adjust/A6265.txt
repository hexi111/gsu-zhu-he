In a recent movie 'The devil wears Prada,' people may see that the main character's appearance and fashion become gorgeous as she becomes successful in her career. Fashion and appearance are a part of expressing oneself so that it can be highly encouraged to people. However, this pattern sometimes drive people crazy and consequently bear a lot of social problems, such as anorexia, bullimia, and too much plastic surgeries. 

First of all, too much attention on personal appearance results in numerous patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and bullimia. There are a lot of celebrities who are suffering from anorexia and bullimia, including Nicole Rich. One Brazilian model died of annrexia. The more problematic thing is, those celebrities affect young girls and make them mimic celebrities' behaviors. As a result, this 'rich society' has some 'hunger kids' who are suffering from anorexia and bullimia.

Secondly, too much plastic surgery is ongoing. Plastic surgery was once considered as 'celebrity' thing, but now people eager to fit into a typical beauty, and they try to fix their own appearance as an artificial one. For example, it is now common that a parent have their child plastic surgery as a reward for their entrance to universities.

Contemporary society is quite opened compared to modern era. As a result, expressing oneself is a natural way and even encouraged by social norm. Fashion and appearance can be one way to express themselves effectively, but too much attention blows social and individual problems.
