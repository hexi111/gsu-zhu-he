I like when peolple look nice and drees nice. Contrary to the generally dominating opinion that the attention which people pay to their appearences is not good, and that they should take care of their spiritual being, I believe that the negelct of one's own body is the most utter reflection of the negelct of the spirit.

I grew up in the culture where it is a must for a woman to look nice, and often visiting a University can turn out to be attending a fashion show. Life in America showed  to me a completely different view on the matter: students do not care much about what they ware and you can even find students dressed in pijamas or wearing home sleepers.  Many call it an expression of freedom, for seemingly, you stop judging person by his/her apperence, but begin appreciating "who he/she really is." This, of course, is a myth. Apperence has always mattered and always will. Besides, if you liberate your life from the materialistic concerns of appearence, you can not avoid acquiring, and often becoming a slave to, other materialistic concerns (success and performance in school, sports, eating good food, buying expensive cars, etc).

I want to conclude by saying, that in many cultures the decoration of the body is not a supplement to one's spiritual existence. It is the spiritual existence itself. 

And it is the problem of the modern society that it bases its values and codes of behavior upon the most destructive dualism of body and mind.
