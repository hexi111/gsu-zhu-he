About this argument, my answer will be very obviously yes. I totally agree with the statement. A good future will not fall off from the sky. Some one want to have a good future, he or she will need to earn it. People need to struggle for it. And after all the efforts they have pay, they can begin to feel satisfied.
That is the reason "no pain, no gain". My conclusion is that planning carefully and planning early can really help you achieve your goal. There are two reason that can perfectly strengthen my opinion.

The first reason is that when you plan a thing, you are actually strengthen it. If you keep plan about your future, you will come up with a perfect way that fit you the most to put you in the position of working to the goal.

The second reason is that once you plan earlier than the others, you will have more time to prepare your goal to have a good future. The more time you have, the more you can prepared. The more you prepared, the perfect achievement you can get.

Although, some people may disagree with me. They may say that even if you plan early, you still may fail. But I will say, in the way of goal achievement, failures are just experience, not results. I will suggest, once you make a plan, select your goal. Go for it. Don't stop because any failure, untill you success.
