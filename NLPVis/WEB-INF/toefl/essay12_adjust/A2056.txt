In my country, it is doctors who conduct plastic surgeries who make most money in different types of medical doctors. It means that a lot of people want to become more beautiful and more handsome. This suggests that personal appearance and fashion are too much emphasized on. There are some reasons why people focus on them.

Although new communication technologies have been introduced since so-called “digital revolution,” the interpersonal or face-to-face interaction is still important to develop and maintain the social relations. In this case, someone who has ugly appearance is likely to become less confident to meet the others than those who have good appearance. So, in order for confidence of social activities, he or she needs to have good looking.

Also, appearance and fashion sometimes seem to indicate one’s personality. If someone who has friendly appearance, it is easier for him or her to be a friend with the others. Otherwise, he or she tends to be isolated from the others, because he or she is regarded as a bad person. Likewise, those who wear humble are likely to be considered as baggers.

In conclusion, it is desirable to pay attention to personal appearance and fashion, at least, in this sense. Everyone live with one another, not by oneself. Good Looking could give good impression, and thus, promote development and maintenance of relationships among people.
