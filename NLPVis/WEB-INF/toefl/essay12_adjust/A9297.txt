Nowadays, the appearance becomes more and more important in daily life. Some people think that the appearance can decide the life in some aspects. Some do think it is important to pay attention to the appearance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. There are mainly three reasons which lead to my opinion.

First of all, people spend too much money on the products related to their appearance. For example, when people open TV, can anyone does not watch a advertisement which is not about the clothes or facial things? When people go to somewhere to attend an official meeting, they will dress up. They do need to wear a proper clothes. But it is not proper to dress some suits cost thousands of dollars which are produced by the world famous brand.  Is it necessary to dress like that? Will anyone be more successful, if they dress the more expensive clothes? The answer is no. 

Secondly, if they spend the money on the more useful fields, such as personal education and donate to someone urgently need some money to get through the hard time, it would be more meaningful. As we all know that the income of people is limited, no matter how much they earn. If they spend too much on things related to appearance, they can not have enough money on other things which can really improve their person skills. 

Lastly, it may also cost their a  lot of energies to pay too much attention on appearance.

All in all, I agree with the statement. If people spend less attention on appearance, they would be more successful.
