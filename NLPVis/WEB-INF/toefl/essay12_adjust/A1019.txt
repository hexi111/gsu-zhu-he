I agree with the assumption that emphasis on personal appearance and fashion is extreme. 

Firstly, when people are becoming more and more educated and as the technology is advancing  they are landing into better jobs which eventually pay handsome salary.Also, they tend to have less time to spend time leisurely(long weekends,holidays) and hence this leads them to be oniomaniacs.  

Secondly, some people tend to have a notion that their extravagnce will help them to gain popularity.But this will not be true all the times-the actual test of an individual will be of his internal beauty and not his external beauty.

Thirdly, the rate at which the technology is advancing and the way the companies market their goods  makes the old goods almost priceless. This allures or atleast gives an oppurtunity for the people, especially the plebain class to buy these goods and have a say in today's fashion world. 

Finally, the way the fashion industry or the glitz people dress attracts the people especially, the kids (some of them whom consider them as their role models) to follow their path. 

Hence, too much emhasis on apperance should be stopped and people should be made aware of this.Consequently, the humungous amount of moolah saved from this calculated decision should be used as an aid for the third  world countries or during natural calamities.Atlast, I would like to say that "Be simple and be a Sample to everyone".
