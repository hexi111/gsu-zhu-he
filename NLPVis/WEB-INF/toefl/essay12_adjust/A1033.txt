Nowadays personal appearance and fashion plays much more important role in our life. According to a survey people with higher height and more attractive apperance make more money compare with those shorter less attractive people, what why diet control industry and plastic surgery are so properous now.

   Business company wants their employee more presentable since they are part of company's image, besides according to resarch people tend to be more productive while surounded by attracive person.

  Some industry pay more attention on appearance  and fashion than others, like service industry. Good looking waiters get more tips, good looking sales people sell more products, even good looking crime victim drew more public attention. Rememer the girl who disappeared in her graduation trip to a island? ( I think her name is Natarly? ) thousands of people disapear every year, but only her story run on TV news over years since she is young and pretty.

  There is nothing wrong to pay attention to one's appearance, but abses with it is another thing, I saw on TV teenage girls doing plastic surgery in order to have a bigger "bob" while they should sit in the classroom to get more knowledge, I would prefer people with both beautiful outside and inside.
