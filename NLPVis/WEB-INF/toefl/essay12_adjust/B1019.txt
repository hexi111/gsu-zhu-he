I neither agree nor disagree on the assumption.But I believe that a correct planning during and after the young age will help us to have a good future.

Firstly, in an human life,childhood is the most crucial part  because it is the time when most of us dream or aspire to become something.With proper guidance from the elders these dreams tend to become reality.On the other hand sometimes due to extra pressure or due to the wrong choice the individaul may fail to achieve his dream and eventually he might become a looser.

Secondly, as time passes by the child might start thinking to achieve something other than his dream. The incidents which took in his teenage might compel him to choose a completely opposite career.

Finally, correct directions in the childhood and motivation to excel in his adulthood will help to ensure a good future.
