Living in this so fashinable city, New York, Everything is fashion, clothes is, funurture is.  People who live in this big apple seems could not dress not fashion, not trandy.  It is almost another kind of unifon here.  Some of people dress like it because everybody did that.  I think some of people who dressed fashion du to they think they want to be someones. 
    
The massmedia is a reason why people think that.  Almost all of the media reported that rich's people, stars, or any other famous people.  People can easy to know what they dress like.  For a long term, the personal fashional appearance changed from optional to must to dress.  Because massmedia, everyone can easily to know how those people dress like. 

Second, since everyone's think that personal appearance is very important, than people can't dress like what they like before, or dress not up to date.  Because they know how other people will think.  This is so terriable thing, but it did happened.  Some people dress so trandy just want to keep joanese.  They even don't know what fashion it is.

Finally, we know why people dress so fashion nowadays.  Because messmedia broadcast the information to everywhere, so everyone can heard, can saw about it.  Moreover, they just want to be expired by someone.  Maybe some designer don't want to heard that, but it is ture.
