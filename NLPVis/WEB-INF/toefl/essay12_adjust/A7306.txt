I totally agree with this statement. Everyday i see people at school wearing weird clothing. I'm not really a fashion person. One that buys new clothing each week. for me, sometimes fashion doesn't even look good. But for some people, it is cool. If britney spears wears something, then most girls would do it. I can't even explain what it is called, but most girls, and maybe boys would wear almost anything that any celebrity wears.

I think that taking care of you appearance is necessary, but putting too much emhasis on it, and in fashion, is a waste of time and money. I believe that it is a waste of money most of all. I've seen that some of my friends have their closets ful of clothing of different colors, tens of shoes, necklases, purses, funny sunglasses, makeup of wild colors, and many more things. but the thing is that they might wear those things once or twice, and then they would buy whatever weird thing they saw paris hilton wearing. So they keep waisting time and money. They keep buying new things, and they don't even have more space to keep new things.

It is always good to look nice, but when it comes to wearing extravagant clothing in the name of fashion, no thanks.
