Careful planning is an important aspect of a person's successes.  Planning a head of time is the best way to manage ones works  and time.  Most of the parents usually start to plan their children's future ahead of time when their children are still young. For example, what king of school their children should go or what kind of after-school activities the children should take.  I agree that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.  For example, when you start to do something early you will have an exact plan on what you want and how you want it.  Another reason why we should plan ahead or start early is that we can always change our plan if we feel that area or topic is not for us. 

Plan ahead or plan carefully while we are still young does not mean that we have to start planning right at the minute we are borned.  Planning for future can take place as late as high school or college.  For most parents, the main reason why they start planning for their children's future is because they want to develope an interest(s) for their children. 

If we plan ahead of time we can know what exactly we want and how do we want it to be.  For example, the reason for most high schools to have so many acedamic classes is because they want to give students a feel on what kind of thing they are expected if they want to continue with the subject they like.
