Where do you see yourself in three or four years? I think that the best way to ensure a good future for ourselves is to think and plan carefully while we are still young. First of all we have to think and plan carefully about what we really want to do in our future.  Planning carefully while we are young is advantage for us, because we are not going to be late to perform our future plan. Whan we plan our future early we may not get problem later like financial. 

When we plan our future we're gonna able to do our plans on time, so we will not waste time. If we only live now what are we gonna do later. What if I live only now and don't think tomorrow? Iam not gonna study and then Iam not gonna graduate so working and earning money will be dream for me. 

Planning is very important. It doesn't matter how old we are. If we need good future or good life, we have to plan carefully about our future.
