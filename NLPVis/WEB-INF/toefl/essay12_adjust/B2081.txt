I agree with that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. 
   
The future to everyone is very important, eventhough we are still young. therefore, ensure a good future, we need plan it as we young. For this, we can have a clearly destination in our feuture. it always said that we need prepare everything already before we begain to do it. 
    
First of all, we need according to our interesting to paln our future. That make sure we have a good begining, and we can also save the time and enegy to decide what we should do when we are grouping up.
    
Secondly, we need pan very carefully, every details we need have deeply consideration. For example, our life lokks like the stairs-step buy step, so when we plan our future ,we need do like making the stairs. if we skip one step, we may have fall down. Then we lost time and effort.
     
Additionally, Whatever we thougt, planing carefully also is a significant part of our future. It looks like the the key to the door, or the foundamental to the whole building. we need make it very strong enough. 

We know that all the successful man have the carefully plan foe their future. they know what they want ot do , and then they steight the way untill the destination.
      
Like we usually said, everything needs have a good plan, then it can easily success. Generally, I totally agree with that planing carefully is the best way to ensure we have good future.
