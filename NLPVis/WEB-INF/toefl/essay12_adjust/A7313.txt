I strongly agree that Nowadays, people especially young and teeagers are very sensitive of appearence and fashion.

In fact, many factors are leading to this trend. The most important factor is what can be called "Hollywood effect"
people are getting enslavered by the Television showing the lifestyle of stars, singers, movie actors, divas etc . As a result they want to just be like them by paying highly more money than they can really efford in clothing, cars, luxury items..

For instance, I have near my appartment two families who apparently compete on cars. Anytime one family change a car the other family will do the same thing the following week, same thing with expensive clothing and out of price vacations.

Also, the fact of being a "slave of fashion" leads many teeagers to dangerous appetite of money. This can lead to chaos in their life if their parents cannot afford to buy expensive "en Vogue" items. Many children lost their lives because chasing easy money on drugs, gangs, rubbery to just appears high.  

This trend is worldwide, In Africa, young people amazed by what they see on television, think that wearing a expensive clothes is being really alive but  the question is: is that the value of a person? 

As a conclusion, I will say that,appearence and fashion is not a sign of being happy in life, a true person is the one with human heart. Share what you have and contribute to make this world a better place.
