The issue of topic is whether the best way to ensure a good futher for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young or not.  Some people believe that is the best way to keeping young, while others are not think so.  Different people hold different views dut to their different distinct background and experience.  In my perspective, I agree that the best way for my future is not do so more plan right now while I am young. 

First of all, we can not control everything.  There are lot of things happened which are not in our control.  No people can definitily sure what will be or what will not be.  For example, the weather, people still can not make forecast 100% everytime excetally same as the fact.  I don't think everyone can have a good future because they made a good plan when they were young. 

Moreover, the things wont happen like everyone who plan.  Base on the first point, since we can not sure what we can get.  People should change their plan depend on every single pieces of time, every situtation.  People should make their plan base on their living enviornment, not only follow the plan which made before.

To sum up, many people think that the bast way to ensure a good future for thenselves is to plan carefully while they are still young.  But the everything will not like in our plan.  However, we should change our plan up to date, not only follow the plan while we make when we are young.
