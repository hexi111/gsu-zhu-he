It is difficult to agree or disagree with this statment, because it is made on the premise, that a young person has a perfect judgment as far as what exactly needs to be done; that he/she is fully aware of the difficulties that wait for him/her in the future, etc. What happens in reality is that such knowledge is not always present in the person's consciousness--whether for a lack of an appropriate mentor who would instill such knowledge in the disciple's mind, or for the reasons which are exclusively personal and can not fall into the category of reason or common sense. Thus typical would be an example of what is often called a rebellious child, who refuses to take the path his parents chose for him, preferring instead the life and philosophy of "living in the moment." On the other hand, if the judgement of a person is within the bounderies of what we often label as normal, variations can also take place. For it is not an unusual thought, for example, especially for people of faith and religious affiliations, that the picture of the "perfect future" is but an illusion; and what is important is the cultivation of one's soul, rather than accumulation of goods for some remote prospect of a better life.

As far as my personal view of the problem, I do believe in hard work, even if it comes at the expense of the momentous pleasures. I saw poor life, and I saw that among many reasons, the major causeof such povery has always been a poor judgement of the possibilities that the present offers to a person in respect to his or her future. I do not claim that the person should be always calculating which step to make in order not to fall, but some level of foresight is would never hurt.
