I don't agree with this statement.

I really don't think that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I have several idears to sopport my point of view.

First, look back to the history. 

Only when people were rich and the country was strong, people could pay more attention to appearance and fashion. Because only after people didn't need to suffer from poor, hunger, death, and illness, they could develop their heart for good outside.

In the history of western countries, people pay more attention to appearance and fashion when the whole country is richer and stronger. Like Rome(I don't know weather I type the name of the country the right way, and I am sorry for that.), 2000 years ago, when it was strong, people live in there had bath more often and the buildings were more complicated. 

Second, people live in nowadays even haven't pay enough attention to appearance and fashion if conparre to the history. 

Now, more and more countries are much richer than any time back in history, and more and more people don't need to suffer from poor and well educated.
But the attention paid to appearance is still not  as much as the good times in history.

So I insist that people nowadasys should pay more attention to apearance and fashion.
