The best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. Is that ture? Though some people think that the statement is right, others cannot agree. As far as I am concerned, I do not think so. I believe that the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to set goals for myself form time to time.

The best way to ensure a good future for youself is to plan carefully while you are still young. It is not a bad thing. If we plan our life while we are still young, we can have a goal to go for. People will have the insensitive to do things once they have a goal to achieve, which can help them work effectively and efficiently. The problem is one does not know whether the plan is good for him or her while he or she is still young though the plan would sound good. 

I think a better way to ensure a good future is to set goals for myself from time to time. With the growth of oneself, a lot of things will change such as his or her interests, belief and so on.  For example, thousands of children wanted to be soccer stars when they were young. But only a few of them made it. Why? The rest of them also planed their future when they were young, probably more carefully than those who became soccer stars. Life is changing. If they could adjust their goals, probably they could do better in another field.  We do not know what happen in our future life when we are sill young so we should adjust our goals even we think about them carefully when we are still young.

In a word,  I think that planning carefully while one is still young is not the best way to ensure a good future.
