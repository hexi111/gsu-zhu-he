Everybody has their each plan in their future. In their childhood, somebody wanted to be a doctor, the other person wanted to be an actor like that. Likewise, most of them have had their plan for their good future. I agree with planning carefully while they are still young for their great future. The first reason is that a plan makes people diligently. The second reason is that a great future does not happened accidently.

The first of all, I believe that plans usually make somebody diligently. For examle, a person who lost his or her job, and have no dream does not think about his day of a life when he wake up in the morning. In my case, I usually make my own plan frequently even if it does not work. Day by day my plan was a little bit changed, I always tried to consider about my plan and my future. I think I got good results after all.

Secondly, I am sure that a good future does not happened accidently. It means that nobody can get a satisfied result without their efforts and plans. Sometimes, people get an one-night deam like a winning lottery. However, if you look over the story of success people, you can find in common. They have planed carefully while they were young.

Therefore, I firmly believe that the best way to ensure a good for themselves is to plan carefully while they are young. Because of making people diligent and  there are no happening accidently without plans and efforts.
