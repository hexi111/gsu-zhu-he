I agree with that. There are several reasons. 

People should plan they future as early as possible. The earlier they plan they future, the most likely they will success. If people want to success, they should make a lot of efforts. The earlier they start to do it, the better they will perform.  For example,  when I graduate from college, I try to find what I was interested in and look for the job based on my interesting. I got the job I like, and I performed well in my job. That was becasue I planed it before I looked for a job. 

Also, while you are still young, you have many chances.  You can go to school or find a job easily. After get married or 35 years old, it become difficult to do what you want. Therefore, carefully plan your future, and make efforts about it will more likely success.
