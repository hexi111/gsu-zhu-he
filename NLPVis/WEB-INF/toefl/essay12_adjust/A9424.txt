I agree with the opinion that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearrance and fashion. 

Nowadays, with the development of economy of the whole society, people are not satisfied with only the food and living condition, which are the most important factors many years ago. They have more requirements of appearance. For example, in China, several decades ago, many people were living a poor life. At that time, the country just survived from a war and social economy is declining. My mother told me that in her childhood, they do not have enough food, not to say pay attention to personal appearance and fasion. But recent years, China is developing very fast. Many things that we can not image before gradually appear in the market. People are becoming rich. So they have enough money,time and ability to put many emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, especially young people. They like to cater to the fashion tide. 

Secondly, I think in the modern world, the personal appearance is one of the aspects to express oneself. Sometimes people need to pay attention to their appearance. As a student, one may have a chance of a formal party, a career fair, a graduate ceremony and so on. As a businessman, one may meet a situation to attend a conference, hold a meeting. As a teacher, one need to be a good example of his or her  students.  They need to pay more attention to their appearance. The whole more society becomes more complicated than many years before. People have more chance to show themselves. In many situation, a good appearance of one person gives others a good first impression. So people put more emphasis on their personal appearance and fasion. 

In sum, I think nowadays people put more emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. It is reasonable. It is useful to show one's best in different situation. As long as one have enough ability, they can pay attention to their appearance as they like.
