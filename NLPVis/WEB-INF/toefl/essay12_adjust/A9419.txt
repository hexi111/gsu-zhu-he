It is somewhat true that nowadays people put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, whether their owns or other people's. This may has something to do with the current wildly-accepted materialism resulted from developed economic. While some may think this is no big deal, others argue that focusing too much on appearance is superficial and of only skin-depth. It is sometimes true when we see people who spend most of their time, energy and money on dressing their exterior appearance but scarcely any on the inner beauty. Furthermore, the current problem of credit card debt may also has something to do with this trend. People simply cannot stop buying things, without thinking first whether those materials are necessary or affordable. When Madonna sings and dances with "Material Girl," many people buy it as their own philosophy and simply run after it too seriously. 

Moderate emphasis on personal appearance and fashion is not a bad thing; after all, that is our human nature, just like other animals. However, it is improper to spend too much time and money on this, because becoming too materialistic is potentially harmful and may make people neglect some more significant, richer goals. Princess Diana dressed in fancy clothes but she did not forget her social responsibility, and she truly dedicated a lot to charity. Finding a balance between emphasis on exterior and interior appearance is very significant, and the time, money and energy spend on the former should always depends on our ability, monetary or others.
