I agree that in developed countries like America, too much emphasis has been placed on personal appearance and fashion.

This is evident when we see how youths flip over the newspaper sections on war and poverty to the two page Macy's sales advertisement; stay glued to the newest episodes of "America's Next Top Model" or "Project Runway", over the Discovery Channel; follow avidly the trends of seasonal designer fashion and movie stars and have no inkling about issues discussed in Congress and the political candidate representing their district.

Though taking pride in one's external is indeed important, as seen from the way our first impressions are based almost 70 on the visual input. Being well-groomed reflects on an inidividual's character as well. However, the fact that plastic surgery, Botox, liposuction, teeth-whitening procedures, and Lasik surgeries have formed a whole new definition to 'corrective medicine', shows how much pressure society has placed on the way we should look.

Consumerism has also spurred the rise of fashion. Magazines and tabloids dedicated solely to clothig and what movie stars wear sell millions more than academic journals. The chase for the newest car, technology and accessories never ceases.

In conclusion, I believe that in developed countries, it is indeed true that far too much importance have been placed upon the external as we have learnt to judge by the standards set by society.
