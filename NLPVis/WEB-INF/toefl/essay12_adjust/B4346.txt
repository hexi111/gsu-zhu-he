I remember hearing stories about outrageous X-generations, Y-generations etc. living lives as they come.  Compare to young generations in these days, I think they were decent. People, both young and old, in this dispensation really seems to be living in the moment.  "Live today, die tomorrow." Many choose to live more like an short living insects than human beings.  In such times, it is easy to forget to see the bigger pictures of life and plan ahead.  
Having to live a life without the ultimate goal and plans, is like driving without a map and without the destination.  
Although it is true that we can't always choose how our lives would go, planning ahead is the only assurance one could get for getting a good future.  
Making goals such as getting an education or proper training ensure us with better chances of employment and consequently with more financial stability.
