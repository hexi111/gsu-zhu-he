Nowadays there emerges a trend that people become more focused on what appears outside than the inside attributes.  It is not unusual that given the same products, the one in a fancy package is always more popular than the plain-looking one.  Somehow human nature determines this trend-- good-looking things or persons always get  more attention and that explains why people pay more and more attention to their appearance and the fashion the society leads. 

First of all, did you ever notice that nowadays a movie star might earn millions more than a research scientist? Does that mean a movie star really creats more value to the society than what a scientist does? It is absolutely not the case. The unequality between the contribution and return makes people believe that pursuing fashion and better appearance can create fortune in the future at a lower cost or say in a much easier way. That's why we saw more and more people are doing beauty surgeries to make their image look better despite of the huge inherent risk.
 
In addition, people naturally base their judgment about other people on what they look like and how they dress like. People found it much easier for them to survive if they have a better appearance and dress in the latest fashion, which could win them a lot more respect and lead to an ultimate career success.

Finally,  the mass media educates people to focus on appearance and fashion. Cosmetic advertisement, fashion shows are everywhere and communicating to people what the latest fasion is.

I can only say the trend that people are paying more attention on  their appearance and pursuing the latest fasion does exist and which is determined by the general trend inherent in the society.
