I agree with the best way to ensure a good future for our self is to plan carefully while we still young. there are some reasons.

firstly, if we make plan for our future when we are yung, we can study subjects spacieatific what do you want to be in your future. for exsample, when I was high school student, I had not my plan in my future, and I did not Know what should I do after guraudatre high school and I lost my way. so, we should make plan in young age and we should study eraly about own future.

secondly, we could save money if make a plan for future when we are yung. for exsample, I am 35 years old, but now I am students and I am studying for my futture still but I hve not job even thghou 35 so, I do have mouch money with me. if make plan for my future when I was young, I got good job and earn money.

therefor, these reasons, we should make a plan when we are young is best way to ensure a good future for ourself. we can study that  foucus on your future and get good money.
