A good plan means a good possibility in the future. Actually a good plan does not lead to achievement directly, while it is a motiviation for the success. 

Nobody wants to be completely upset when he/she is young. But unfortunately, only a few parts of us try to make a detailed plan when we are still young. Some of young people just play or work. Are they wrong? Obsolutely not, but that kind of behavior without any thinking or plan for the future makes people naive and short in eyes. Sometime, people make a plan just because they have to. For example, they have to record everything in their notebooks and schedule a plan carefully in order to accomplish all of the things, or to make them not forget anything.

This kind of situation needs to be changed if you want to be a successful person in future. In fact, the best way to make a plan is try to think about what you will do in the next few years. And from now on, you should begin to do some preparation for them. For example, if you want to study abroad, you can not just wait there without doing anything. At least, you should prepare some specific examinations for studying abroad. For instance, our internationla students need to take TEOFL test before we turn in the application to the universities in U.S. So a pre-thinking plan is extremely necessary and important.

On the other hand, a good plan can reduce your risk of loss. If you were a maketing manager, you have to predict the future situation and try to make some plan to deal with some particular condition. We can not imagine that a good market manager just follow his/her boss's advice and do not predict at all. What a shame he/she should be if that happen. 

In conclusion, a good plan can do something useful to help you have a good future. Although a plan does not mean a success, it can benefit it.
