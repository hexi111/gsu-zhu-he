I would rather think that people just put right weight on their appearance and fasion.

First of all, personal appearance or looking shows the respect to others. When we go to a conference meeting or party, people all dress up appropriately. This is one way to deliver a message to other people that I take it seriously and I am honored to be participating this event. Don't underestimate its importance. We saw a bad example when we went up to SF for a control conference meeting. One person came into the presentation room, wearing casual shorts and T-shirt. Imagine it! Do you think he went there seriously? Do you think this is a right way to greet others? And do you think everybody else feels good? Even he didn't mean it...

Secondly, arranging personal fasion is also part of people's wonderful lives. The whole world is developing nowadays. People are finding out more options on what they can wear, especially for ladies. People with different taste wearing differently, how amazing that is! Such kind of diversity is exactly the essence of beauty in this world. 

Therefore, I feel people are just putting about the right emphasis on their appearance.
