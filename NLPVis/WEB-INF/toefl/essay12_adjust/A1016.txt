The world has been experiencing great change today, especially in the way people value various things.  It is true that people today spend a lot of money on personal consumption such as clothes, shoes, make-ups and so on.  The purpose of doing that is to make themselves seem more attractive or more fashion. 

First, fashion industry is a good index to show that people emphasize fashion.  For example, thousands of kinds of megazines write about how people should dress, where people can get the most current accessories, or how famous stars dress themsevles.  People love to buy these expensive megazines and follow up the trend.

Second, changes between old and young generations also demonstrate that people are getting more sensitive to appearance.  As can be seen from the street that young people are wearing all kinds of weird clothes and shoes, which they think are the fashion.  Old people, comparatively speaking, are not as fashion as young generation.  They usually don't think it is good to spend much money on those colorful clothes. 

Last but not least, girls especially spend lots of time making up, usually with famous brand make-ups.  A lot of friends of mine told me that they spend at least an hour dressing themselves before they feel confident enough to go out.  The time and energy they are willing to put into appearance clearly show that they emphasize fashion. 

All in all, the above phenomena demonstrate that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.
