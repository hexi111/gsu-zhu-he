I believe that the first glance determine the people's image, and most of time it works. Moreover, most people know abd believe this fact. 

I had a real experience of this. When I was young, I went to the mall to buy something. When I wore nicely, a clear treats me very nicely. However, when I wore just pants and t-shirt and glasses, it was totally different. Plus, I am pretty sure that most people also have these kinds of experience like I do. 

Plus, every advertisements, TV and magazines emphasis fashion and personal apperance very much. As we living in the material culture, there is no choice that we can out of these environment.

Therefore, there is no choice that most people put too much emphasis on personal appearnace and fashion, or not, they also know that how they looks to other people and how they are treated.
