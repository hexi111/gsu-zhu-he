Planning carefully in advance to ensure a good future does not always get the anticipated consequences, but it is no doubt one way to add some possibility, just like purchasing insurances. While a person is still young, he/she is potentially more energetic in both the physical and mental aspects. Therefore, it is the golden time for one to pursue his/her goals with full energy and dedication. Some people may hand in a brilliant transcript regarding their impressive accomplishment, while others may be simply ordinary or even fail. Regardless of the external factors, planning in advance is sometimes helpful for a comfortable future in certain aspects. As mentioned, buying insurances is one of the cases, and eventually time will prove that today's investment will be tomorrow's profits. Many elders lead a comfortable life because they plan carefully when they are young, and thus they can live independently without having to add financial burden on their children. Preparing for one's career track is another instance. A person who aspires to become a scientist has to spend a lot of time acquiring sufficient knowledge in this field, just like one who wants to be a swimmer has to practice over and over as necessary preparation for the future career. Sometimes success can depend on fortune, but to most of people, success has much more to do with personal efforts. People tend to focus on stories about other people's lucky success, like those lottery winners who turn into a millionaire in one night, without realizing that this is only an extremely small portion of successful tales. The most dependable access to a good future is on our own hands. Despite there may not be a so-called "best way" to ensure a bright future, planning carefully while one is still young is always a safe way and may eventually lead one to his/her dreamed future.
