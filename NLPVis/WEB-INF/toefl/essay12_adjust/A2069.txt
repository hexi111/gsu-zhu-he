Today and tomorrow are very different. What is today may not be there tomorrow and what will be there tomorrow may not be there today. This what describes fashion too. Today's clothes which are fashionable may not be fashionable tomorrow. Was there an I-Pod five years ago. No. This indicates how dynamic fashion is today. With this respect, it is important that people put emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. It is bad to have people moving around in bad fashion. This can only be prevented using pressure. This should come, either from rules and regulations of an office or from social/peer circle. It makes the world very appealing to the eye. Just imaging how dull the world would be, if it was only a desert. God gave humans the power to think and inovate. The ability to appreciate beauty. The ability to appreciate things around us. It will be very frustrating for the human eyes to be surrounded by aesthetically unappealing things. Especially, in this time of concrete roads and steel skyscrapers, we need something to motivate us to walk in this world, something to motivate us to get up and goto an office to work. And this helped by viewing fashionable people around us. 

On the other hand the personal appearance of a person should not be used to make the final judgement of a person. A wolf can appear in sheep clothes too. In other words, a person can be bad if he or she has a good fashion sense. The reverse is true to. If a person has a bad fashion sense or a shabby personal appearance, it is not necessary that the person is bad. It could be that he/she has fallen in bad times or did not have the time to take care of his/her appearance before going out.

I would like to conclude by saying that, it is good that emphasis being put on personal appearance and fashion, but not too much emphasis should be put.
