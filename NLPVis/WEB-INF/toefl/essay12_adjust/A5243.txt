The statement is a tricky one and I think what it conveys is absolutely right. People these days are putting too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. But I think that is the trend that is needed to be followed if you are living in current era. I think that change is inevitable in any field and fashion is no exception.

In olden days, emphasis was given on work and qaulity of work than on  appearance and fashion. There was not much cultural emphasis and not much emphasis on appearance as such. This might be due to many reasons and one of the reasons can be the lesser competetion for work. There were less number of people, lesser work, lesser competetion than what is there today. If you are trying to get a contract or a job, what mattered in those days was your ability to work and nothing else. 

But, these days, apart from work, your personal life and your attitude is also under scrutiny. There are many people who have the ability to work for the same job and one needs to have a special quality to prove himself/herself unique and I think there is no better option than your personal appearance.

The way you present yourselves in front of a big crowd, or in a party etc essentially earns you a lot of praise for what you are and also shows the uniqueness in you. This, according to me, is done by having an emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

Also, fashion world in changing day by day and one who dresses and appears in a better way and follows latest fashion would be the person who keeps himself/herself abreast with the latest developments in world. 

Thus, I conclude by saying that fashion and personal appearance are both essential for a person to survive in present world. But as there is always a limit to everything, I also feel that excess fashion and excess emphasis on one's appearance doesnt earn much and instead emphasising on our own strengths and inner beauty would be helpful.
