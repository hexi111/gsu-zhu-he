Nowadays there more and more people want have a better life in the future. At the same time, lot of books talk about how to secusse in the future have been selled in the book markets. Facing this question, different people will give different answers back. Some of them think we should make a good plan when we were young. And then, going ahead step by step. Others hold their opinion that we need very lucky to help have a good future. Whatever others say, for me, making the plan carefully is the best choice.

First of all, any oppetunites we will meet in the future are kind of challege. It's not easy to do. We have to prepare for it before we meet it. Although there are some people have good future just because of lucky, it's not common. Ganarally, if you want to a good future, you should work very hard. For example, my father, he  lose a oppetunite to study in the university because history reason. But he never give up the dream of him, he make a very good study plan and do it step by step. Right now, he is the president of a big company. the story of my father tell me, mybe you can get a chooce to go to best university without anything, if you still waiting for luck coming, the good luck will leave you.

Secondly, although we will meet somthing we can not do in our plan, we can adjust it and make it fit for new situations. It is not mean that you do not need work very hard. Doing it step by step is the most significant thing.

On the whole, making a  plan is the best method to help you make your  dream becoming ture. Foget about good luck please.
