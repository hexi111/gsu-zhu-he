The old people always say that planning before start will bring you good luck. Indeed, being prepared for everything can bring more succeeds than if not. As the same, when you are young, life is right at the beginning, and you can benefit from whatever you do ahead of action for the following reasons.

First of all, no one knows what the future would be before you start. But planning carefully will help you form your life goal sooner and clearer. Just like driving, if you start without looking at the map, the ratio of reaching the termination is rare. Maybe you have started heading torwards the opposite direction. If you have not had the destination yet, planning can give you a clear mind of where you are. Once you made up your mind, there is no turning around.

Secondly and even more important, well planned will give you more chance of catching the oppotunities passing by. In one's life long, many oppotunities flys by, whichever you catch will change your life dramatically. However, those few who catched can succeed. If you are not planned, when good luck comes, you cannot be ready. In another word, if you want to succeed, planning is the prequisit.

However, every sword has two blades. Sometimes, if  things don't happen as planned, it is relatively difficult to be flexible, which is a great obstacle toward success.

In a word, nothing can ensure a good future but trying our best. On average, being prepared is a good way to increase the possibility.
