Appearance and fashion are very important to people, the young, as well as the old; the women, as well as the men; the ordinary person, as well as the elites. As the development of economics, and living environment, people pay more and mor emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. However, in my opinion, people nowadays put too much attention on their looking.

As has been seen in our society, virous brands of skin care,  cosmetics and dress take most of counters in the shopping mall, and most of advertising time in the media. Concering too much with the good-looking, catching up with the fashion, people are easily stimulated to consume on those goods. Whenever the latest products appear, the public always run to the counter and purchase them. No wonder the one who benifits is not the consumer but the merchants.

In addtion, in order to let themselves looks excellent, people spend a lot of time before they go out of home. One of my friends, a college girl, usually spends nearly an hour to make up and dress.  At the same time with the external emphasis, however, those people have neglected internal development. It is most harmful for students. The topics around the young are always the brands, fashion, shopping, skin-care, and make-up. Meantime, they have forgotten that their primary job is not letting themselves look good but gaing knowlege and enhancing themselve. In fact, a lot of people with ample knowledge, altough not good-looking, are still attractive. Internal appearance is much superior to external appearance.

In short, people in the world concentrate too much on the external appearance, which is actually not good for them. Internal quiality, including knowledge, characters, personal traits are much more important to the public.
