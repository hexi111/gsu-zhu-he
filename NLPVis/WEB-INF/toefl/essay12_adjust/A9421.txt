 I strongly agree that people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion in recent world.  People can get a lot of information from mass media such as TV programs , movies, magazines and so on.  Those information convey a material desires to people and tell people how important of their appearance and feature.  
     
There is a very dominant example to support this phenomenon.  In Asia, girls like control their diet to have a slim body.  They want to wear very small size dress in order to say "I am pretty and sexy."  Why do they want to prove themselves like this?  The reason is they assume that if you perform like a supper model it means you are pretty.  They forgot they are loosing their health when they tracing the beautiful appearance and fashion they thought.  Another example is the young boys and girls tend to spend lots of money on dressing themselves.  You people want to buy the famous brand accessories, have a fashion hair style, or even they want to have a good car.  They spend too much time and money on those things so that they forgot they have to pay more attention on their studies.  They watch the novelist fashion magazines to get the information what is the most popular things nowadays.  All of these showed that   people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion , especially young people.
     
In conclusion, I think people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion now.  This is a result of media world.  Good looking and fashion might bring you confidence but there are more important things have to think not only what you look outside.
