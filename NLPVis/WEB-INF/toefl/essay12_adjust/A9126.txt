With the advent of technology in the 21st century, people are becoming more and more sensitive to visual aspects, that is how they look and what they wear. People tend to watch TV rather than listen to the radio, and read newspaper. I agree with the the position that people tend to overly focus on personal appearnace and fashion these days.

First of all, people tend to be judged by their physical outfit at job interviews. According to the recent survey, the majority of job seekers (70%) reponded that they had considered getting a plastic surgery. Employees are likely to hire those job applicants who are good-looking and nicely-dressed, particularly if they are women because employees believe it will boost morale in the company and attract more clients in the future. 

Another reason is that possessing nice figures and fashion senses are indicative to show social status these days. There is a general belief that the rich can change their appearance as they wish through a plastic surgery and receive tailored fitness and diet programs. Also, people who belong to an upper class can purchase up-scale clothing and drive fancy sports cars. All of these can be an effective indicator that 'I am better than others' or 'I'd like to be treated better than others.'

With the two reasons described above, folks in modern society spend an excessive amount of time and energy in keeping their hard wares. However, one should keep in mind that the brain is stronger than the body and true beauty lies in the mind. We should note that body and the mind should be balanced at least.
