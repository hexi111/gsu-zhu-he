"Never judge a person with his/her appearance", which was said by my mom when I was still young. My mom told me that because she did not want me to be a bias person, which means she want  me can have my own opinion on the others by communication with them, making friends with them, while not by looking at the expensive glasses and shirts on them.

In fact, what my mom said was completely right. While a good appearance is also important for today's life style.  Firstly, even most people have gotten rid of the bad habbits to judge a person with his/her appearance, most of them still respect a person in good appearance more than those who just wear in the most geneal appearance. So a good appearance can earn your opportunity for being respected at least. 

Furthemore, a good appearance is also necessary for some specific jobs. For example, a lawyer should were suits in the court, which because they must respect the boble of the law. We can not believe a lawyer who wears a jeans or even shorts in the court and say something about the importance of the law. What a joke it is! Another example is in the businesss area, people always dress themselve very well because they try to maintain the principle and style of the business. They wear a good suit not only because they want to show their higher income than common people, but show their professional spirits for theire jobs.

On the contrary, I do not think people should pay too much attention on personal appearance and fashion, only if they are fashion models or their jobs need them to do such as a designer. That because pay much emphasis on personal appearance will influence your judgement of a person. You may only notice his/her appearance while ignore the most important part of him/her, the charactor. So that is not good to do that.

Finally, I agree with that a good appearance is important but I still believe in what my mom said.
