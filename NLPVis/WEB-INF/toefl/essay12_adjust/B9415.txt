Life seems like a marathon. If a person have a dream or goals of life, one walks toward the right direction step by step and slowly. We often see cases that someone change their job to other works that the third-person doesn't expect. The problem and cause return the childhood of people. Indeed, did they have a own will to decide their future?
   
Many cases show that a lot of people who change job later are strongly influenced by their parents in childhood. That is, regardless of their own will, they are forced to go some direction according to parent's will. Finally, times pass by they grow up, they rethink their future deeply. In many cases, they aren't satisfied with their jobs or goals, they reestablish life plan.
  
The concept 'young' is a little ambiguous, but for the most important thing people in the childhood take a many discussion about your future and life plan. If it doesn't add individuals' own will, it might be a weak future plan. Also, if they plan their future with own will, it doesn't guarantee your future is bright. Children have not yet known the world exactly, they should open the all probability. It's difficult to change a path of life, it should be good to take a time.
   
In conclusion, it's somewhat dangerous to set a life
