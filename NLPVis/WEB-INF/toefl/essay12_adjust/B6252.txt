When I was still in my primary school, my parents taught me to make plans for my summer vacation. That was my first lesson about plans. As I grow up, I realize that plan is really important for success and I could not agree more with the argument that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young.

Future success is accumulated little by little. Since it takes time, it has to be planned at an early age. If you have good plans, you know what you are going to achieve, you know how to prepare yourself for you goal, and you will obtain what you want in the end.

When you look around at your friends, you will find that people who have good plans tend to have a better future. For example, if one set up one's eye on going to Harvard University, he works hard on course work, he takes part in different activities, he joins the math competition and he develops his leadership skills. He plans this well, he follows this plan and he will have an excellent future.

People who don't have a plan or who have a plan too late will fall into embarrassment. Training yourself to be capable of something takes a lot of time and effort. If you have this capability, you choose what you want to do and where you want to go. People who don't plan the life very well will have to look around and see what opportunities they have. People with plans master their life, while people without plans are mastered by life.

Success is not a lottery, instead it is accumulated step by step. You set up the goals for each step, you plan your ways to get there, and then you win. Good plan helps you see forehead, good plans give you confidence, good plans avoid wasteful efforts and good plans make you succeed eventually.
