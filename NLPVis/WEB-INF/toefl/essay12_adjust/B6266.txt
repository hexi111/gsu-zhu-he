I disagree that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. People may not know what they want to do in the future when they are high school or college students. Some people may not find out their future plan even after graduating colleges. Young people with little experience cannot find out what they want to do. Even if they decide their future plan at earlier age, they may change it as they grow up.

For example, in my case, I wanted to become a pianist or violinist when I was a high school student. Then, after I started studying at colleges in the United States, I switched my major into mathematics because I found that I liked math and wanted to learn it seriously. Eventually, I began considering career related to math. I got a risk management job. In this way, I found out what I wanted to do in my future at college after experiencing many fields of study. More importantly, I am satisfied that I could find the field that best suit me.

In this way, people get to know their real interest after they experience many things. Considerable amount of time is required for it. Therefore, planning your future while you are young will not ensure a satisfactory future.
