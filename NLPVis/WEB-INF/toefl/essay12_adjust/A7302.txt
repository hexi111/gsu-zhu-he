While Living in America I realize that people are very in to their self, they care allote about what they ware and going with the latest fashion. But is it healthy? I dont think so. 

As a student in the university i see alot of people are showing up very formal as if they are going to aball party, and other student showing with sleep ware!. I believe that each occasion  has its own appropite clothes, compairing office clothes, where people show up in very formal looking , that is okay, but they wont show up with begamas. 

Another example why people like  following the fasshion because they dont want to be left back and seen as old fashonest. People like that are triying their best to find approval from others. and on the other hand, nowadays people that dont have sence of fashion are not liked to be socialized with!. I agree with having some fashion going on in the socity but in conveniant places that has dress codes. we cant stop people from going after the flot. 

I believe nowadays that people are imphasising in theIr look and they are so obsest with fashion.
