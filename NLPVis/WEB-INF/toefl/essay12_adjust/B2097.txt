for the problem that whether you need to plan your future carefully while you are still young, I would very interested to show my idea about this. I have no idea what age for "young" here.  But in my opinion, the good future of a person have not big relationship with his or her  plan.

Because for one thing, you can not choose the environment. Although the plan is made, the changing environment will affect your following affairs and plan. it's difficult to say that a plan will bring you a good future.

For another thing, the essential thing for  good future is some good feathers of people rather than just a plan. I t is no doubt  that a proper plan put on a person with good properties will probably have higher rate to get a better future. But for majority of people, they have better to do some current affairs heart and sole. I think that would be the most effect way for getting success.

Besides, a young person's experience is limited, there plan can not achieve a very high level. It will be better to do there current study and experience situation at first. Then their future will be much better than make a plan so early.  

In a nut shell, I don't think a good future have big effect with making a plan at young.
