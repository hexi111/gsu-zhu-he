The emphasis on personal appearance and fashion is a very personal statement.  I agree  so a certain degree that people should emphasis on their appearance and spend time. The reasons for me to stand by my statement is because people always judge by the way carry yourself and the way your portray yourself.  Fashion in terms of clothes or accessories mainly defines the personality of the person and displays his or her taste. But at the same time any thing that is done is excess is always not good.

Firstly, I feel fashion and personal appearance makes an impact on any person you meet. People will always be judged by looks and the way they carry themself. Dressing well and appropriately can improve the opinion about people. It also displays the interest and care about oneself. 

But on contrary, any thing that is done in the name of fashion should be tasteful and classy. The clothings must also be comfortable and easy to maintain. These days, we see many types of clothes in the name of fashion which are not very practical for normal wear. It is either not designed for normal average frame of human body or very revealing and akward. 

Fashion has also  created a  negative effect on the teenagers these days. It creates a false status and prestige issues. Everyday the fashion changes creating a sense of outdated feeling among people. It should not hurt the common man who can afford high end fashion.

These days having designer labels and branded clothes have a huge popularity. It gives people a false status leve, which can create imbalance in the society. This could be a major cause for fake product business to grow. People who cannot afford the branded products yeild in for the fake ones just to maintian the social status or prestige.
