I strongly agree with this statement. We can have our life is only once, and it is not possible to going back to our past, so it is important to have a nice plan for our future. Some people can argue with me because our life is not going to be what we made a plan, but it is better to have at least a little achivement than nothing.
    
First of all, we need to have our life plan because we do our best for our life when we have our aim for our life. There can be mistake while we can running for our life plan, but it is also good learning experiance. After we learned something from our mistake, we will never do it again because we exactly know what was wrong. In the contrast, when something happened in our life whille we are living without any aims, we just think that happened with any reason, and we repeat our mistake again later, because we don't know when was wrong, and what was wring, and how to fix it.
    
Furthermore, when we have our life plan, it is easier to achive our dream than not have any plan for our dream. For example, there is a girl who wants to be an opera singer. To be an opera singer, she might need a good voice teacher with whom she will have voice lessons regularly, a good education from music school, and to go  to competitions. If she make a plan, she can follow her steps to make her dream comes true. As she follow her plan she can be closer to her dream. Franckly, she can not be a singer like a Renee Flaming, but at least she tried for her dream, and she will amit the result because she did her best with her plan. On the comtray, there is a singer without any plan. It is rarely possible she can be a star, but our life is not a gambling, it is once as valuable.
     
In conclusion, I agree with this statement because with carefully planed our aim, we can achive our life goal and get a good affort from our life.
