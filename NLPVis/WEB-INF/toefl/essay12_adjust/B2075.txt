A good future for me would be to be able to work hard enough in order to provide my children with pently of opportunities to enjoy life. I mean, traveling, studying abroad if possible, and getting familiar with as many different cultures and people as possible.

Planning is a good way to start, I can plan what I want to do in the next five or ten years, but planning also stops you to do things spontaneously, and those things are the ones I consider important and significant in life. Planning your financial incomes and outcomes for the future is important, that way you can adminitrate better and save for traveling, visiting museums and vacation. However, even if you plan sometimes events happen and you have to cover those events even if you are not prepare for that. For instance, if you are saving for a vacation and all of the sudden you got sick and do not have medical insurance, you have to spend your savings to get medical treatment which means you have to start saving again. 

Planning can be good when you a certain that you are going to stay in the same job for a certain period of time. In this case you know how much money are you about to make, how much can you save, how much can you spend on rent, food, etc. Nevertheless, nobody can asure you that you will keep that job, and in that case what is the purpose of planning? 

The future is somewhat uncertain, nobody knows for sure whta is going to happen in the next year, the next day, or even the next hour, for that reason I will say that we have to enjoy this day and this moment to the maximum, as if this were about to be the last day of our lives, only by doing this we can admire the little things that are next to us and that we do not normally notice. That is the only way in which we can be happy.
