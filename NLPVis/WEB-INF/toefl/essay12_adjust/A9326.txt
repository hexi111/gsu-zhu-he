An old Russian proverb says that a person is greeted by his cloths and farewelled according to his mind. That still remains a reason why people are so concerned about their appearance. Even nowadays, when mind and intelligence are considered to be prior qualities of a person, one tends to put too much emphasis on one's appearance and fashion.

   Fashion is an important aspect of self-esteem. According to Maslow's hierarchy, the top of person's necessities is self-esteem. In order to be accepted in a society or a community as a respected person one tries to affect by appearance. For instance, a new employee fills out his closet with several new suits and dresses and comes to work in different cloths every day to impress his colleagues. He needs to gain respect as a neat person or as a wealthy person.

   Wealthy people also put too much of emphasis on their appearance and fashion. A new dress that was individually designed by one of the most famous cloth designers in the world would increase popularity of a pop-star. Each music or movie ceremony is more of a podium rather than a cultural event. Impression made by cloth follows by moving up by the ladder of importance. 

   Importance of appearance is growing every day and becoming more fearing. A developed society should put more emphasis on intelligence of a person rather than on one's appearance. As a very profound English proverb says: "Don't judge a book by its cover", the world should consider the personality instead appearance.
