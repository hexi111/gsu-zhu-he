Most old people say that the best way to ensure for our future is to prepare carefully when I am young. However, I disagree with the statement. Because eventhough we prepare carefully, there are many variable things in our lives and our life is worthy to challenge.
 
First of all, human beings are the feeble creature and Ican not predict our lives. Eventhough I carefylly prepare for our future, there are many variables and ican encounter unpredictable situation. For example, I saw a movie "my little sunshine". In the movie a boy was earger to fly jet so he didn't talk to anyone. to keep his mouth shut shows his will. One day, he found he is a color blind. He can not fly jet. I can not imagine the frustration that he felt.

Second of all, sometimes I prefer to meet our future or fate without preparaiton. If my lofe is well scheduled or prepared, I think I feel like to escape from it. Sometimes I want to encounter my unexpected life and challenge it.

If we prepare our futurecarefully, we can have better future. However, I strongly disagree that because there are many variables in my life and I want to enjoy something unexpected thing.
