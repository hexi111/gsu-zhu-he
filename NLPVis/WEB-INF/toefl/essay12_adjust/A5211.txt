Fashion and personal appearance are a major trend that we cannot ignore in the culture of our society and therefore, I believe that the emphasis that is put by people is important and necessary and not at all exagerated. 

Today there are a lot of factors that decide what is trendy and what is not. The media including hollywood plays a major role. They are all part of this modern culture and should be considered very important. Fashion statements set by celebrities, clothes designers and cosmetic companies are models we should follow.

There could be no denial that good looks and fashionable attire have always made a huge difference in the way we perceive each other. And this has always been true even since ancient civilizations centuries ago. The French nobility and bourgeoisie in the past was very well known for their sense of fashion and their attire, their grooming and the cosmetics they wore (including both men and women) distinguished them from the pesants. 

It is true that nowadays, there is no more social ranks as "nobility" or 'pesants" however, we can still differentiate someone with "good taste" that keeps up with trends by looking good according to today's fashion and someone that denies the advancement of our society by thinking that fashion is overrated and ignores by chosing untrendy and bad looking clothing. If one should call him/herself a member of today's society and wishes to be part of a culture that is evolving at a fast and exciting pace, fashion and personal appearance should be a great concern. That is the reason why the emphasis put nowadays on personal appearance and fashion is not exagerated in any way.
