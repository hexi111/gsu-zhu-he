I agree with the issue of the best way to ensure a good future for maself is to plan carefully while I am still  young.  The reasons ar as following.

To begin with, life itself is a advanture.   We cannot know everything before we've done it.   Therefore, we should think carefully before we start to do something.

Although it may be still some changes, we can easily deal with the problems because of planning before.

Second, it is our life that we should care about by ourself.  If we set the life plan when we are still young, it is easy for us to retire earily and enjoy the rest life with our family and friends.  For example, we have to take excerise everyday to stay health.   Also, we should save more money rather than spend money when we are still young.   To in case we can enjoy the rest of life, we should think further and plan carefully when we are still young.

Third, people never know what will happen just next second.   In case we will have accident anytime, we should plan carefully.  However, some people think it is too annoy to think about everything before it happen.  Planning carefully may not be the best way to ensure a good future, it can still reduce the hurt of the accident to you.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to plan carefully while I am still young.   Furthermore, everyone should think about his/her future carefully when he/she is still young.
