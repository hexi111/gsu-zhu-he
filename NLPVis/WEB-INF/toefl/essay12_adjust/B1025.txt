I partially agree to the fact that it would be best for the furture to plan from the young. I would rather agree by mentioning the age at which one will come in close contact with the outside world and when one can start identifying good for oneself. It is at the age of 20 when one can take the respsonsiblities of onself with him/her until then will be only under the protection of parents.

I would consider the age of 20 as relatively young and agree to the point that one has to start planing for the future right from this age.

In my country, India, it is at this age we choose our specialization in Bachelors and until then will be in schooling. So choosing the right Bachelors is a critical decision one has to make. So one has to plan and ask himself about his/her likings on the subjects and choose the right area of specialization. It is this age where one gets matured enough to understand between good and bad and take the right choice.

It would be rather very important to plan financially also, from this age, to make a clear future for his higher education, and then for planning a marriage and family. It would not make sense for one to get into marriage at the age of 40, which might also happen if one had missed to plan the right thing for his future. 

By missing to plan early, one will be bound to accept the future taking its own direction, where he/she had to sacrifice their own passion in life and so on.

This is a competitive world, where no one can take chances. The economy runs in money where time is relatively propotional to money. If time is lost, it cant be brought again and one has to loose the period for building onself.

So plan early, plan the right way, enjoy the time and make a right future. If one plans for his/her future early, even if he/she slips, it would not hurt enough and there would be enough time to come back. So in all way, planning earlier is always safe and better.
