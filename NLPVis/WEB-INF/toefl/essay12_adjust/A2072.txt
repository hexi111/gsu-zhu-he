To realize the fact nowadays people care too much about their personal appearance and fashion is not difficult at all. When you go to work, just tell a colleague that he or she looks great today. I bet nine out of ten times the person will be a happy bird for the whole day. Similarly, if you want to let a lady down, the simplest thing you can do is to remind her that she has gained some weight this week.

The zeal for a better appearance has become an epidemic. Every product, no matter what it is, either shampoo, toothpaste or exercise bike, as long as it can make the hair shine, teeth white, body in shape, will never worry about the sales. They are never out of demand. The bourgeoning beauty industry is another good testimonial of this trend. Ladies are happy to spend thousands of bucks and undertake whatever trial to just make them look younger. 

The reason behind this overemphasis is worth noticing. It seems that the quick pace and high competition of the modern society have created much anxiety in the public psychology. People are trying their best to remove this pressure, and they have found that a good appearance can make them confident. They believe they can succeed as long as they maintain a good public persona. That explains why many people would spend more time dressing up before a job interview than preparing for interview questions.
