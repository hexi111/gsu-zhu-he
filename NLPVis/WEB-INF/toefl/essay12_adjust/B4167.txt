I think I agree with the statement given here. A good plan helps us in minimising the risks and problems that we might face at a later point of time.Even though we know that the future is uncertain we can certainly try to figure out what we want to do with our life and how we want to get there. For e.g I am studying computer science because I know that I enjoy working on computers and I can have a good future in the field. Also I know  that US has a number of good universities for this field. Thats why I planned to move all the way to US to pursue my dreams.

If we do not make any plans, it will only lead to confusion and chaos. Also planning later in life may not be so effective. When we are young, we are more flexible with our views and ideas and our entire attitude towards life. So even if our plans go awry, we can still tweak our plans to fit the circumstances. But as we grow older, we do not want to change our lifestyle too much as we have become accustomed to our ways. Maybe thats the reason that the government encourages people to invest in retirement funds like 401(k). By investing our money right now we will secure our future life. Even though it means that we have less money to spend right now and the money will stay locked up some place for another 30-40 years but it means that we have planned for our future.

Of course, a good future is ensured only if we plan carefully. We need to be able to take stock of our present and plan accordingly. the plans should not be too vague or too unrealistic. They should be well within our means. We should make a long term plan and then subdivide it in to short term plans. This way we can keep track of where we stand in making our planned future real.

Thus, I agree that life is about taking chances but having a good plan goes a long way in turning those chances in your favor and thus securing a good future.
