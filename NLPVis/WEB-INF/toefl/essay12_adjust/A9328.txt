With rapid development of technology, our life styles have changed as time goes by. As a matter of fact, our society is changing from agriculturally to industrially. This big improvement has put a significant influence on our everyday life. What's more, different values of all walks of life come into play. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. I have three following reasons for this agreement.

First, people become much crazier about the celebrities and idols in a modern society. Since the standard of life style has been raised highly for these decades, people start to care about how celebrities live their lives. For example, a large number of teenagers and youngsters may stay up late in order to line up for the live concert of their favorite singers. In addition, they may purchase products of those artists, such as calendars, photo album, and so forth. Some become so addicted to the idols they love that they want to have the same haircut as their idols do.

Moreover, a variety of technology and media also influence people's values. Within such a global village, every one can surf on the Internet without much difficulties and acquire what information he or she may need.  For instance, a Chinese teenager can have the chance to know more about  American pop singer, Avril, by watching TV or videos from the Internet. With easy access to multimedia, every one can search for more fashionable information and novelty.

Finally, it is commonplace that people would want to live a better life and enjoy it happily due to  the sophistication of our life styles. The nature of people is to seek the essence of the life; namely, how to live more meaningfully and merrily. Materially abundant life can give people satisfaction and happiness right away, not to mention fashion.

Based on the reasons mentioned above, I maintain that people nowadays emphasize too much on appearance and fashion.
