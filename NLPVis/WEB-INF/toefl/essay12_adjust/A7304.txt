Currently, as economy develops, our life becomes much better than the past, so some people begin to pay their attention to their appearance and persue the modern fashion. Admittedly, the appearance is the first impression when you meet some unknown person and it is very important if you have some kinds of specific job which needs you to dress well. However,personally, if you pay too much attention on it like many people did nowadays, it could not be a positive stuff, so I agree with the opinion from the title that"peopel put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

As a student, I think we do not need to emphasize our appearance too much. But the fact shows a totally different picture. Take most of my roommates as a example, normally, they takes nearly 1 hour in the restroom to make up and change clothes quite frequently. Obviously, this is a waste of time. Because the only goal of student is studying. Dressing well will not increase GPA, however, if you did too much, it makes a negative effect on your studying.

As a employee, in my opinion, in most case, they don't need to takes time on it with the exception of some jobs which depends on their appearence.

Making yourself more pretty and handsome is the natural character of human beings, but if you paid too much attention, it will only distract yourself.
