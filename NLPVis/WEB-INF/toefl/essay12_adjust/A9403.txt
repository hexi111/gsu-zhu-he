Nowadays, personal appearance and fashion become much more important to people. It is a hot agurment recently, someone said that people too emphasis on personal appearance and fashion and neglect everthing else , such as, politeness. After a deep consideration, I tend to disagree their statement. I think the situation is fair and it can not be defined as too much. It is because appearance can lead you to success and show the respect; it can show your status as well. Therefore, I think the trend is going fine; and I am going to explain the detail in following.

First of all, catching the first impression from someone is essential. When you meet with someone who you do not know; your appearance is the first data they can obtin from you. They will jugde you by your appearance, you can have a further developement if you dress up well. Otherwise you will be ignored, and lose all the chances. Therefore dressing up is half way to success. So I agree people put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, it is absolutely not too much.

Beside, focusing on personal appearance and fashion is a kind of respect towards other. When you attending  any meeting, if you dress up like a road-worker, it is a kind of insult to the event holder. So you should focus on your own appearance and fashion in order to show your respect to the host. Therefore people people should put their great afford in appearance and fashion,
So there is nothing going too much nowadays.

All in all, from what we have discussed above, people should emphasis on appearance and fashion. it can lead you to success with well dressing. Furthermore,  It is beacuse it is not just an indivdual matter, it shows the respect to other as well. Therefore concentrating on personal appearance and fashion is essental nowadays. Therefore we can conclude that everything nowadays is staying fine; and we can surely disagee the statement that saying it is too much.
