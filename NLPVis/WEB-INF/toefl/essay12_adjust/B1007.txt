People say that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young. I do not agree this "no good plan, no good future" idea. For this disgreement, I have two reasons.

The first reason is fairly straightforward. You are still young. Thus you either are not sure what is the most impront thing you want for your future, or, even you know what you want, you do not kwow which way will lead you to your goal. So what and how do you plan for when you still young? Most of times, we need a guidence from the elder or pursure by yourself. These all take time. An easy coming plan is not guarented to be a good plan. I even don't mention the possiable damage to your future if you stick to a bad plan. Therefore, my point is that a bad plan is worse than no plan at all. Don't hushly make any plan before you really get to know youself. 

My second reason maybe sounds passive: nobody can control what happens to your life, even you are armed by a good plan. Things chang. Accordingly, you plan has to change. Planning carefully while you are still young is actually wasting your time, since you neve know what is going to happen to your life and to your plan. Sure, having a plan is a good thing. However, the dark side to have a plan is that you will feel frustrated if you can not carry on your plan when things change. You probablly will think you never have chance to get your plan done. 

I do not agree that you should plan carefully when you are still young, but I am not saying that to have better future you should have no plan. Nobody could gain  benifits from sitting around. I believe that you should work hard when you are still young, build your plan eventually, and make your plan adaptable to the real world.
