Nowadays, people spend more and more time and money on personal appearance and fashion. I think it is not necessary to put too much emphasis on it. 

Appearance and fashion is not important for communication with others. Some people will argue that they care about their appearances and keeps fashional so that they can give better impression to others. It is ture, but not worth it. Good manners, Good sense of humors, being friendly to other and etc. will play much more importance when you communicate with others. A rude person will never win respect from others whatever he wears. 

In addition, it is expensive to keep in fashion for people.  Coloring hair will spend you $100 and up, buying new clothes will cost even more, wearing diamonds will spend your one or two months' salary. However, you will never catch up the fashion even if you spend all of your money on it. 

Instead of putting time and money on appearance, a better way is to educate yourself by reading and learning. You will learn a lot of knowlegde and the way to communicate with others.  Also, it is much more cost-effective.
