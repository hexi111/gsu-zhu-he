Nowadays there is a heated discussion of which people should or shouldn't put too much on personal appearance and fashion. Different people have different opinions. Some people think it's not a big problem that put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Others disagree their opinion, their idea is that people should put more emphsis to something useful and worlthly. No matter what other people say, in my opinion, people shouldn't put too much emphsis on that.

The first important reason of me is the personal appearance and fashion are not necessary for hunman's life. We can not life in a world without air, water, tech., knowlege. But fashion is different, we can life well without them. On the other hand, the fashion and personal appearance industry makes lots of bad influence for example killing wild animals. A huge numbers wild animal are killed by this reason, because some fashion people just need a little part of their body the make clothes, shoses, and hats. 

The other significant reason I hold is that people can pay more attention on other useful fields such as education, sports, music, arts... All of those are more hlepful for human development. Although we have a rich and comfortable life, we also have mang risks. We should work it out as soon as possible. It's not jok. If we always focus on fashion things, who save us in the futhure?

All in all, in my opinion, Paying too much emphsis to pasonal appearance is watse time and our resouce.
