Appearance is the first thing that people would think about when they are going to meet a person. People always judge people by their appearance in their first meeting with a new person. People with a shiny, fashion outlook, he/she is always welcomed by public. Conversely, people do not like to get in touch with those people who are dressing in dirty shirts and messy hair. And, handsomes and beauties are always get the envy sight from other people when they are walking pass a street. Therefore, people nowadays starting to put more attention on their outer look, for example body figure, clothing, hair styles and etc.

One of the reasons that make people to become more emphasis on personal appearance and fashion may contribute to the advertisement. Everyday, we will contact with different kind of media: newspaper, television, magazines, computers and etc. There is a common thing that is show on these media is advertisement. Clothing advertisements are usually advertised by models who usually own a good and sexy figures. The frequency that the advertisements show usually is proportional to the impact to the public. When the advertisement appears at high frequency, it will implants in the audience mind easily and it can last longer. After seeing those nice figured models, audience will start to become envy to their good figure and make themselves believe that they will become attractive if they own the good figure as the models do. On the other hand, the fashion that shows in the commercials also make the audience have the desire to own those beautiful clothes and cool hairstyles. 

As I have mentioned above, a person with good appearance usually attracts the eye sight from other people. For those people who loves to show off, they are more emphasis on their appearance.
