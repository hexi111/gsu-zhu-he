I agree with this statement.  It is good that people have afford to care about their appearance and fashion, and of course it is free to wear any clothes.  Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.

In Japan, we usually wear uniforms when we are junior high-school and high school student.  There are reasons.  One of the reasons that some people care their appearance and fashion more than studies, so if there are uniforms we don't need to choose clothes.  Another reason is to avoid to show different level of life.  I mean, needless to say, there are rich people and poor people, but if we wear the same clothes, there are less difference between them.

In my opinion, it is good to care about personal appearance and fashion, but it is not good to put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion because some people are not satisfied with their appearance and take a plastic surgery.  It doesn't mean that plastic surgery is not good, but I have doubt what beauty is.  It depends on a person, but recently they got influenced by mass, I think.

Wearing diffferent clothes is a way to show our characters, but it is also important to scrub our inside.  We are different.  Sometimes we put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion, and miss important things, so I think uniforms are good system.  It is good to care about personal appearance and fashion, but it is important not to forget that we are different and we have each good things.
