I agree with this statement.  Even if we become an adult, we still have an oppotunity to change our future.  However, it is clear that children have more oppotunity to change their future than adults.

Recently I met a Japanese cartoonist.  He said that there were usually three of four turning points in our life.  The first turning point is when we choose the university.  The second one is when we choose the job.  The third one is when we get married.  The last one is when we change our job.  We can choose our future, and there are turning points.  If we make a mistake at the turning points, it makes you to away from your desirable future.  So, we have to plan carefully.

For example, if you want to become a pianist, you have to begin playing piano while you are still young.  It is difficult for a 30-year-old person who has never played piano to become a pianist.

Finally, needless to say, our life is limited.  Therefore, we have to plan carefully while we are still young in order to ensure a good future for ourselves.
