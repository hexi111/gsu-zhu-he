Nowadays, people put more and more emphasis on appearance. I don't think it is a good direction for our socerity. the reasons are stated as follows.

firstly, putting much emphosis on appearance and fashion not good at one's study, especially for students. If they have the fixed income every month, and they spend the majority money in clothes and make up, they they must have not enough money to buy books and stuff relative to study. Besides, their energy will be assumed too much on these fashion stuff. Thinking that your time is 24hor/day, if people always thinking about their appearance, their energy will be wasted on these useless affairs. So, it is obvious that putting too much emphisis on appearance will bad for a person's development.

Well, maybe some one will say"the staff's appearance have close relationship with a company's development ." We don't think think it's wrong, but however, It will prevent a company, even a society's progress if people put too much too emphisis on appearance. For it's more important to study some useful problems rather than just make up and wear beautiful clothes. 

Last but not least, the rate of poison will increase if people put too much emphisis on appearance and fashion. Because these fashion stuff usually very expensive. If someone want to get that but one have no money, they probably use bad ways to get money for jewelery, makeup, clothes and bags for decorating their appearance.

In a nutshell, it's not a good thing to put too much emphisis on appearance or fashion. it will not good for a person and all society's development.
