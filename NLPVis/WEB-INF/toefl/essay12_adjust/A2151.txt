Personal appearance is an important thing for each one, I think.

Straighter will look at your appearance fist and arrange you to his own style in his mind.  If you looks dirty or unclean, he will think you are rubbish man;  if you looks common or general, he will think you are like a country man and not fashion;  if you looks like older than your age, he will think you are not alive;  but if you looks fashion, special, young and dynamic, he will think you are great and somebody.  You give the straighter a first special impression.  You will be easy to know each other, because your personal appearance make you popular and easy to be accepted.

When you go to an interview to get a job or other important things, such as you instead of your company to make a contract or you attend a very important meeting, maybe your personal appearance will give you more confidence and opportunity to success.  If your appearance make you lose or lose a chance, you will regret with your the whole of the rest of your life.

With the society such fast developing, the young must keep the speed with the developing.  I think it's become a custom or a common thing like you should wash your face and brush your teeth when you wake up each morning.  Put much more emphasis and time on your personal appearance and fashion, you will have a wonderful and happy life everyday.
