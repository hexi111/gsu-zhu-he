I partially agree on this.  One of the reasons for putting emphasis on your personal appearance is related with your own self-esteem.  If you feel well about they way you look, your chances of getting into a social network will improve.  Additionally, there are jobs in which your personal appearance and fashion are a must.  Then depending on what you want to do in your life, your appearance will or will not count.

However, people must accept you for what you do and how well you do it regardless of your appearance.  Your potential for a job is not on your clothing or the perfume you are wearing, it is in you.

Nevertheless, this does not imply that you must be careless about your appearance.  You don't need to wear designer clothes or perfumes to look well.  You will be able to look well as long as you keep certain personal hygiene routines.  Routines like wearing neat clothes, brushing your teeth, doing a neat shaving and having clean and well-clipped nails will sometimes be enough for making a good impression.

All in all, as the common sayings read "appearances are deceiving" and "not all that glitters is gold".
