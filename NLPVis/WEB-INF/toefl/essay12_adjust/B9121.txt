 As people are growing, they will face new situations. Some deal with the new situation in a successful way while others deal with it in a stressful way. As a result, some attribute the success to luck, but others attribute it to thier effort and prepararion. So, I would like to agree the statement. 

   First of all, I think the effort to prepare my future gurantees my successful life. Because nobody can expect what will be happened in the future, we have to prepare ourselves for the unexpected future. Likewise, planing help us prepare and motive ourselves to go to my dream and happy life in the future. For example, when I was a high shool student, I want ed to be a sport psychologist, and go to the U.S. to study the subject. So, I majored in psychology, minored in physical education at college level. Now, I am in the master program of sport psychology in the U.S. To accomplish my goal and dream, I motivated myself to prepare my unexpected situation. I can easily get the admission from the graduate school, they gave many credits on my career to study the subject. I am proud of me because now I think I enjoy my successful life. 

   Also, plans help us solve the problem that will be occured in  the future. Let's assume that we are going to explore a new land. What if we do not have any plan, how could we handle the unexpected, hard situation. I think exploring a new land is same to my life. We have to solve problems, and make a decision efficiently. If we do not have any plan befor exploring my life, we will easily fail to accomplish my goal and dream.

  In sum, it is very important for young people to have various experiences. However, while experiencing many things, they have to have a plan about what I need for my dream because preparinng myself has a lot of benefit for our future life in terms of motivation and direction to my successful, happy life.
