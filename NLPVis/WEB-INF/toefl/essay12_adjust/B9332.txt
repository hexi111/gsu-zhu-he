I do not agree to the idea that careful planning while I am young ensure a good future for myself due to the following reasons.  

Fist, it is possible that what is planned in childhood can be changed dramatically.  For example, I wanted to be a medical doctor when I was an elementally school studnet.  So, I studied a lot to be a doctor.  In Japan, it is really necessary to go to a good university with a program giving a preparation for a doctor, which is usually very difficult to enter.  However, my future plan changed when I was a high school student.  I was very interested in a language that I was learning, which was English; therefore, I decided to study the language more and to become a teacher to teach the language. 

Second, it is possible that parents can give influence on your decision when you are young.  In Japan, it is typical that parents have a lot of expectation what they want their children to become.  Therefore, they put their children to clam school so that the children study a lot and enter good universities.  However, the parents' expectations do not always promise a good future.  For example, many children in Japan now commit crime because they feel too much stress from their parents.  

Based on the two example, I think that it is really difficult to conclude that the best way to ensure a good future for myseolf is to plan carefully in childhood.
