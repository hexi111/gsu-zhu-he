There is a saying that hands a valuable meaning to us : "Do not judge a book by its cover." Many people seem to forget the meaning it gives us. People started to judge others by their fashion or appearance rather than their personality or knowledge. So I seriously agree that people put too much emphasis on personal apperance and fashion. 

That the luxury brand Gucci or coach are leading our fashion trend might be caused by our tendency to think importance of our appearance. To immitate the fashion of several celeb's, some people buy those luxury stuffs that they cannot afford to. We can relate the increse in the number of plastic surgery. People try to their appearance to make them look different. 

However, I now have to say that these are not all to judge people. We have other standard such as personality or knowledge. However, it is sad that this our society forget about them and does not try to promote more developmental atmosphere by making campaining related to our human beings. 

In conclusion, our society is becoming to the slave of fashion and appearance. People tend to believe as they look. However, we have to think about that nothing is cannot be compared with our value as human being. It cannot be subejet to other artificial value such as fashion or appearance.
