Nobody knows what is going to happen in the future, but we all know one thing -- everyone wants to have a good future life. People go to school and study hard to make sure we are on the right track of life and to get ready for the future. Planning for future is better when we do it while we are young. Here are the benefits.

Those who are lucky enough to think about early in their lives have more time to plan and work on their goals. They have more time-- time to think about what they really like to do, time to get ready for what it takes to be what they want to be, or time to decide that what is not for them and find other path. Suppose that there are two people -- person A decided what he wants to be the future when he was in highschool, and person B who still did not know what he wants to do for his life after he graduated from a college. Which one do you think have a better future? Having more time means more efforts and more resources to plan for a future. With more efforts and resources, there is got to be a better future. Putting more time and effort ensures better life in the future. 

Having a better life is everybody's goal. Future life is something that we can build up and we work hard for it. Plannig for future while young allows more time to think about the future life so that we can put more efforts, and that does ensure a good future for us.
