A proverb says that "a person without an aim is like a ship without a sail in the ocean". A ship without a sail has no specific direction to go. Similarly, a perosn without a goal has no specific direction in his or her life. It is essential for a person to plan his or her future goals in young age. 

Another proverb says, "Time and tide waits for none." Once the time is gone, nobody can claim that back. Our young age is the most precious time of our lives. This is the time to make plans for our future. This is the time when we build the steps to reach our goal. If someone waits idle thinking that it is the luck that would lead him or her to the goal, that person would surely apologize in long run. 

A good person never waits for the last moment to finish his or her work. He or she always plans ahead before doing any task. All the famous and most reknowned charactersitics in the world, planned their future goal ahead of time. For example, Bill Clinton, the most popular and famous president of United States, decided to be a political leader from his early age. He planned his future goals step by step in a young age and achieved the highest position he desired in his life. We should take examples from him.

If we plan our goal at an early age, we are more knowledgeble about the requirements that are needed to achieve our goals. If we don't plan about our future goal, we would most unlikely to achieve success in life. Suppose, someone wants to be a doctor, but he or she hasn't plan about that before, so this is possible that he or she may find it difficult to study the specific field because of not planning that beforehand. 

In order to be successful in life, it is crucial to plan for the future at a young age. By planning for the future goals, one may  realize his or her ability to be successful. We all must decide and plan our futre goals at an early age.
