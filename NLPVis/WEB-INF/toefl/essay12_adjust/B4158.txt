Planning is a way of forming a successful rout. it is the dream that all of us begin our day to work for it. Yes, I would agree planning for good future when we are young, will lead to quick achievment. Starting young safe  a lot of time to develop the success and starts another goals. 
 
Most of us have more than one plan, and might had more than an achievment. most future dreams have similarties such as getting a degree, then having a good job, start a family or looking for a partener. however, some people comeup with unbelievable plans so they keep struggling for it to approve their diffrent way of life and change the typical future goals. those who we call the pioneers and those are some of historical people.
 
though, i still agree that planing early would give the time to work very well for the future. but it doesnt mean that nobody can start late. later is better than nothing. i have met people how start late in thier life but at the end they achieved something and approved that they can be successful. plans are not the good future itself,  dreams need work and hard work is the only way that guide to achievement. 
 
for me, i had been lucky determaining what i want in my life and that was in early stages so i still working and working very hard to get.
