Today, more and more people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. Facing this phenomena, I don't think it is so good for our society due to the following reasons.

First, the cost of personal appearance and fashion is so high. I can't image what kind of results will be if somebody is addictive to the shopping personal appearance and fashion accessories. I saw a TV show called "the big spender", where a lot of people bought so many clothes, and then just put in the closet with new tag. On the other hand they owned huge  money from the credit card company,  such as 20,000dollars per year.

Second, there are so many people in Africa who are starving in Africa and Asian. If you have so much money to spend on your clothes, diamond rings, why not donate to them, and why not contribute to the church to help poor people. Maybe the personal appearance or the fashion things can bring some happiness at one time. But I believe your favors to other people will bring you happiness forever. 

The last but not the least, some so called fashion things are very environmentally friendly. A lot of companies, such as LV , they used animal fur to make the expensive purse, outwear. I wonder if they consider the animals' feeling. The only thing that I am sure is that they are just concerned about how much income they cam make every year. I am wondering if they feel guilty to do so.

So from all above, I have to say that I totally disagree with the much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion nowadays. It is really important that we should put much emphasis inside.
