One of the central tenants of the Western culture is a belief in careful planning of one's life from early age on.  This reflects in such things as retirenment plans that one has to start fairly young to ensure trouble-free old age, as well as travel saved for retirment when time is abundant.
  Not all the cultures support and value similar worldview.  Although, the future is never disregarded, young people are expected to enjoy life in the present. I, myself, grew up in the culture of the second kind. Many people in my country, for example, plan for their retirement age  to depend on both government benefits and support and kindness of their children and other relatives. Being a product of my home culture I rely on the notion that careful planning of one's future is not only unnecessary in my young years but even something that can spoil the joy of living my life here and now. I  also believe that if a person is not constricted by the notions of building one career or one life, he or she is free to create a whole new narrative of his or her life every once in a while - start a new career, acquire a new hobby, marry somebody else, move to another country - the opportunities are always broader when one has very little to lose in a Western understanding of this not!
 ion.
  In other words, I do not agree that the best way to ensure a good future for myself is to paln carefully for the only reason that I would like my future to surprise me.
