Personal appearance and fashion seem to me are something that will never be over-emphasized, since it is human nature to pursue beautiful things, and to get attention from others by being attractive.  I do not agree that nowadays people put too much emphasis on these issues.

It is not a phenomenon that is only noticeable in our times. When we look at the human history of arts and lives.  Fashion and cosmetics are always ones of the features that we can notice and document the development.  People care about how they look and how they dress, even in a very simple fashion.  It is not just the female, but also male people are aware of how they look like.  In a word, it is just a human nature to emphasize the personal appearance, and the things related to fashion. 

People's appearance and fashion design actually evolve or change with the same weight in their lives.   For an individual, there are different ages, occasions and stages of life, and there are different ways to dress to fit different needs.  For the human beings, there are different periods in history, and different cultures in the worlds, which shows different ideas of personal appearance and fashion, with the same amount of emphasis.

This might have been an age-old issue that people talk about and work on what and how they look like.  Even when we imagine the lives in the future, we also picture different kinds of personal appearance and fashion.  It is just an obvious fact that issues like personal appearance and fashion are never over-emphasized.
