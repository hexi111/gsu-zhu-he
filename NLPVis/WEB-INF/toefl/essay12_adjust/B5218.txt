People always say that "the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young." This statement looks quite reasonable at first glance. But a further consideration will reveal there are some problem of the statement. Thus I will only partly agree the statement as the following reasons.

First of all, it is hard or even improssible for a young man to understand herself/himself well enough to make a perfect detail plan for her/his future. Young people usually treat things much easier than they really are.  Take my experience as an example, when I was young, I thought I am going to be a biologist simply because I am interested in observe all kinds of bugs. But when I began to take the biology course in high school, I found that it is much harder than I thought and it is not interesting or even ugly to deal with bugs all day long. On the meanwhile, I found I have talent in social science subjects and also I like to devote myself into that. Then I realized how funny my plan is to be a biologist when I was young. 

Also, everything is changing, especially for a young people. No only people, but also the environment. If the plan is too fixed, then it may not help but hinder you future development. For example, if I plan to go to America for graduate study after I my becholar degree, but I can't get the Visa, then I need to change my plan.
