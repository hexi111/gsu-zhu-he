I totally agree with the statement that the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young for the following reasons.

Firstly, when someone plans his future carefully while he is still young. He has a lot of time ahead of him to work for his plan. On the contrary, if someone plans his future when he is old, there is no much time left for his plan. For example, if someone plans to be a doctor after he graduates from high school. He will try to get into a medicine school and get a M.D from school and after ten years of hard work, he has great chances to be a doctor. And at that time, he is only 30 years old and with promising future ahead of him. Contrarily, if someone plans to be a doctor around 60 years old, there is not much chance to realize his plan. And for him, there might be not much future instead of the past. Secondly, while someone is young, he might have more spare time in his daily life to work on his plan. When somebody is a little over 20 years old or younger, normally he is single and his life is pretty simple. However, for someone over 30 years old, he is married and probably has several kids. He has to take care of his family and there is much less time that he can work on his perfect plan for his future. Thirdly, while someone is young, he is more energetic than older and is more easily for him to follow and make his plan become real. To learn the same materials or techniques, generally speaking, the 20s, 30s learn more quickly than the 40s, 50s. At the same time the 20s and 30s might have more energy to study or work longer time than the 40s and 50s.  
 
Therefore, in my opinion, the best way to ensure a good future for yourself is to plan carefully while you are still young because that when you are young you have a lot of time ahead of you, much more time in daily time, more energy to work on your plan to ensure your plan can be realized
