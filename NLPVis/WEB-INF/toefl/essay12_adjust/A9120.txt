Yes, it appears to be true that some people do care too much about their personal appearance and fashion. 

One related issue I have just seen on the internet news the day before that comes into my mind now said that there is a strong bias on people's appearance when a employer chooses workers in some area in China. It was not about the fashion but was about the persons height as I remember. It could be reasonable if it was a recruitment for athletic related cases, but in fact it was a recruitment for teachers at school. Howe weird is that to have an ideal height for a teacher to teach in a classroom?     

Another phenomena that I heard it is being common recently is about a 'petit' plastic surgery in Japan. Although I do not know anyone around me in my real life who has undergone that, a word "puchi seikei" ('petit plastic surgery') is commonly understood. It is said that it is getting more familiar to people to get that as it is a small change (that is why 'petit') such that it will be done in a short time and without being hospitalized. I have heard that this tendency is much stronger in big cities in Korea than in Japan. Since I am from Japan, this sort of reports on TVs and internets including such ads are quite familiar to me and hence it makes me feel like that some people really do care about how they look.

On the other hand, I cannot fully agree to the statement to mean that all or most of the people are like that. Most of I know are thtose who just simply enjoy how they look, maybe a little too much for just once in a while such as when they get too nervous about going to dating for instance (and especially when we are younger, i.e. when we do not have much experience yet in social life). Normally, people around me just stays as they feel comfortable.

To see those situations given above, I partially agree to the statement on people's consciousness about their outlooking.
