In these days many people is looks like interested in personal appearance and fashion. I think pay attention to improve their appearance is good, but situation about that in our society is seveal. Sometimes we consider our ourfit important than than our mental or inside, it would cause increasing plastic surgery and over-buying trend. 

First, many people doing plastic surgery although they are beautiful enough. We are covered with massmedia which is focing us to be same. We are watching same TV chanel,
admire same skiny model, and want to buy same clothes that the model wear. We want to be more and more beautiful than before because the stars and models have more skiny body and big eaies than what we having. After comparing them with us we can make decision to do fix our face and body. Massmedia don't tell us inside is more important than outside. What they want to do is make us think we are not beautiful because they want to promote and sell their product.  

Next, we are buying many products that is actually not needed because we shoud decorate and appeal ourselves well to live in marketing society. It make us buy a lot of useless things
You can get confidence with plastic surgery or buying a lot of beautiful clothes. However, we can get more happiness and self-confidence from your well planed mind and inside instead of expensive clothes.
