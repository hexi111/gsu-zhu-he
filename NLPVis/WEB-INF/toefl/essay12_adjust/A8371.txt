Personal Appearance is a look of the person when you look at him/her. Fashion is the accesiories or the type of dressing the person has put on. People put much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion nowadays which according to me is a right way to go. 

Appearance of a person is the first imperssion of that person who watches. The opposite person first looks at you and than the talk starts. If the first look itself is not pleasant the person will not be willing to talk to you anymore. The appearance of the person should be decent and plasing to attract the opposite person to talk to you. So according to me personal appearance is the important aspect of the person.

Fashion is a part of life in today's world. If you are not according to fashion, you are the odd man out there. Fashion is dressing up to the latest trend in the market, with ate acessiories which goes with the dressing sense. Apperance depends on the fashion. The person's apperance come from the fashion he has put on. If you are not in a fashion may you are outdated or odd man out.

Nowadays people emphasis on fashion and personal apperance for similara reasons. Why would a person talk to you? One should have that Appearance in it so that people get charm by it and talk. It is extremely important to be well dressed according to reason of the meeting to be decent. 

Apperance and fashion go hand by hand. Apperance of a person is related to fashion.  Appearance of the person is major aspect of the his life mojors decision. For a job interview if you go in a party wear jazz clothes than ofcourse you are not gonna get selected for the job. One should be in Official suit to be prepared for job interview. The first impression of your personal apperance plays major role in life.

Inspite of having the personal choice towards the dressing the fashion, one should always try to be with the trends of fashion and also emphasis on the personal apperance.
