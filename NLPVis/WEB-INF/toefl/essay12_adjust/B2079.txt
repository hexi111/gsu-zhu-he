I do not think peole can have a good future when they are planed carefully while they are young.

First, we do not know what will be happen tomorrow. Everything in the world is different, and we can not make things to be what we want. Second, what people want today is different from what they want tomorrow. For example, when they are young, they want to be a teacher, but after a few years they want to be an engineer. So it is hard to make a plan for the future. Third, old plan can not meet the reqirement of today's. When you were young, you want to be a teacher and help a lot of poor students, but when you grow up, you will find out that the real life is what you think used to be. So to my opinion, it is hard to make a plan for the future.

On the other hand, plan is a good thing that can help you more enjoy your life and let you know what you want. But we can not make a plan for everything. To my personal opinion, try you best to enjoy your life right now is more important than think about future. Future is an unknow thing to all of us. What is more, today is also connect tomorrow. If you did a good job everyday, you will be have a good future. Otherwise, what you can do is just think about tomorrow and at last you won't get anything.

In conclusion, we can not make a plan for the future, but we need to know what is the porpuse of our life. Once you know that, you will try your best to enjoy you life and then you can make a good future.
